3642	3663	3623	3623	you	661	" Yesterday , at four o'clock , a young woman threw herself into the Seine from the Pont des Arts . "
3956	3963	3965	3968	a ragged old woman	674	" Wretched weather for drowning yourself , "
3975	3984	3965	3968	a ragged old woman	674	" is n't the Seine cold and dirty ? "
4429	4458	4417	4418	the stranger	502	" Ah , kind gentleman ! _ carita _ , _ carita _ ; for the love of St. Catherine ! only a halfpenny to buy some bread ! "
4525	4542	4498	4503	an old _ pauvre honteux _	695	" Anything you like to give , monsieur ; I will pray to God for you ... "

We have nothing very remarkable here downstairs ; but if I may trouble you to go up to the first floor , I will show you some very fine mummies from Cairo , some inlaid pottery , and some carved ebony--_genuine Renaissance _ work , just come in , and of perfect beauty . "
7625	7635	7637	7639	the young man	493	" You must have the worth of millions here ! "

7676	7697	7672	7674	the florid shopman	843	" but you have seen nothing as yet . Go up to the third floor , and you shall see ! "
7992	8000	8001	8001	he	502	" What is there in that box ? "

8081	8084	8086	8088	the young man	493	" Venture ! "
8090	8098	8086	8088	the young man	493	" then is your master a prince ? "

10541	10553	10555	10556	the merchant	948	" I covered the surface of that picture with gold pieces , "
10559	10565	10567	10569	the young man	493	" And now for death ! "
10602	10614	10616	10617	the other	855	" Ah , ha ! then my suspicions were well founded ! "
10650	10683	10684	10684	he	952	" You , sir , have nothing to fear ; it is not your life , but my own that is in question .... But why should I hide a harmless fraud ? "
10697	10735	10684	10684	he	952	" I came to see your treasures to while away the time till night should come and I could drown myself decently . Who would grudge this last pleasure to a poet and a man of science ? "
10832	10850	10809	10809	he	952	" Have you been a supernumerary clerk of the Treasury for three years without receiving any perquisites ? "
10864	10886	10859	10859	he	502	" Perhaps your father has expressed his regret for your birth a little too sharply ? Or have you disgraced yourself ? "
10887	10899	11016	11016	he	958	" If I meant to be disgraced , I should live . "
10900	10952	10859	10859	he	502	" You have been hissed perhaps at the Funambules ? Or you have had to compose couplets to pay for your mistress ' funeral ? Do you want to be cured of the gold fever ? Or to be quit of the spleen ? For what blunder is your life forfeit ? "
10953	11015	11016	11016	he	958	" You must not look among the common motives that impel suicides for the reason of my death . To spare myself the task of disclosing my unheard - of sufferings , for which language has no name , I will tell you this -- that I am in the deepest , most humiliating , and most cruel trouble , and , "
11031	11044	11016	11016	he	958	" I have no wish to beg for either help or sympathy . "
11045	11050	11067	11067	he	958	" Eh ! eh ! "
11072	11168	11067	11067	he	958	" Without compelling you to entreat me , without making you blush for it , and without giving you so much as a French centime , a para from the Levant , a German heller , a Russian kopeck , a Scottish farthing , a single obolus or sestertius from the ancient world , or one piastre from the new , without offering you anything whatever in gold , silver , or copper , notes or drafts , I will make you richer , more powerful , and of more consequence than a constitutional king . "
11190	11194	11196	11197	the merchant	948	" Turn round , "
11213	11220	11221	11221	he	948	" look at that leathern skin , "
11456	11459	11460	11460	he	967	" Ah , "
11463	11482	11460	11460	he	967	" here is the mark of the seal which they call in the East the Signet of Solomon . "
11483	11491	11493	11494	the merchant	948	" So you know that , then ? "
11519	11535	11537	11539	the young man	493	" Is there anybody in the world simple enough to believe in that idle fancy ? "
11550	11556	11557	11557	he	967	" Do n't you know , "
11560	11619	11557	11557	he	967	" that the superstitions of the East have perpetuated the mystical form and the counterfeit characters of the symbol , which represents a mythical dominion ? I have no more laid myself open to a charge of credulity in this case , than if I had mentioned sphinxes or griffins , whose existence mythology in a manner admits . "
11620	11627	11629	11630	the other	855	" As you are an Orientalist , "
11632	11640	11629	11630	the other	855	" perhaps you can read that sentence . "
11686	11691	11693	11694	the stranger	502	" I must admit , "
11696	11718	11693	11694	the stranger	502	" that I have no idea how the letters could be engraved so deeply on the skin of a wild ass . "
11736	11744	11746	11748	the old man	699	" What is it that you want ? "
11750	11771	11720	11720	he	502	" Something that will cut the leather , so that I can see whether the letters are printed or inlaid . "
11840	11853	11854	11854	he	502	" The craftsmen of the Levant have secrets known only to themselves , "
11871	11874	11876	11878	the old man	699	" Yes , "
11880	11896	11876	11878	the old man	699	" it is better to attribute it to man 's agency than to God 's . "
11999	12006	12008	12010	the old man	699	" So you read Sanskrit fluently , "
12012	12024	12008	12010	the old man	699	" You have been in Persia perhaps , or in Bengal ? "
12025	12030	12032	12033	the stranger	502	" No , sir , "
12076	12087	12088	12089	the glance	985	" He has given up the notion of dying already , "
12095	12107	12109	12111	the younger man	952	" Is it a jest , or is it an enigma ? "
12122	12203	12116	12116	his	855	" I do n't know how to answer you . I have offered this talisman with its terrible powers to men with more energy in them than you seem to me to have ; but though they laughed at the questionable power it might exert over their futures , not one of them was ready to venture to conclude the fateful contract proposed by an unknown force . I am of their opinion , I have doubted and refrained , and---- "
12204	12213	12215	12217	the young stranger	988	" Have you never even tried its power ? "
12219	12223	12225	12227	the old man	699	" Tried it ! "
12229	12642	12225	12227	the old man	699	" Suppose that you were on the column in the Place Vendome , would you try flinging yourself into space ? Is it possible to stay the course of life ? Has a man ever been known to die by halves ? Before you came here , you had made up your mind to kill yourself , but all at once a mystery fills your mind , and you think no more about death . You child ! Does not any one day of your life afford mysteries more absorbing ? Listen to me . I saw the licentious days of Regency . I was like you , then , in poverty ; I have begged my bread ; but for all that , I am now a centenarian with a couple of years to spare , and a millionaire to boot . Misery was the making of me , ignorance has made me learned . I will tell you in a few words the great secret of human life . By two instinctive processes man exhausts the springs of life within him . Two verbs cover all the forms which these two causes of death may take -- To Will and To have your Will . Between these two limits of human activity the wise have discovered an intermediate formula , to which I owe my good fortune and long life . To Will consumes us , and To have our Will destroys us , but To Know steeps our feeble organisms in perpetual calm . In me Thought has destroyed Will , so that Power is relegated to the ordinary functions of my economy . In a word , it is not in the heart which can be broken , or in the senses that become deadened , but it is in the brain that can not waste away and survives everything else , that I have set my life . Moderation has kept mind and body unruffled . Yet , I have seen the whole world . I have learned all languages , lived after every manner . I have lent a Chinaman money , taking his father 's corpse as a pledge , slept in an Arab 's tent on the security of his bare word , signed contracts in every capital of Europe , and left my gold without hesitation in savage wigwams . I have attained everything , because I have known how to despise all things .
12643	12968	12969	12969	he	990	" My one ambition has been to see . Is not Sight in a manner Insight ? And to have knowledge or insight , is not that to have instinctive possession ? To be able to discover the very substance of fact and to unite its essence to our essence ? Of material possession what abides with you but an idea ? Think , then , how glorious must be the life of a man who can stamp all realities upon his thought , place the springs of happiness within himself , and draw thence uncounted pleasures in idea , unspoiled by earthly stains . Thought is a key to all treasures ; the miser 's gains are ours without his cares . Thus I have soared above this world , where my enjoyments have been intellectual joys . I have reveled in the contemplation of seas , peoples , forests , and mountains ! I have seen all things , calmly , and without weariness ; I have set my desires on nothing ; I have waited in expectation of everything . I have walked to and fro in the world as in a garden round about my own dwelling . Troubles , loves , ambitions , losses , and sorrows , as men call them , are for me ideas , which I transmute into waking dreams ; I express and transpose instead of feeling them ; instead of permitting them to prey upon my life , I dramatize and expand them ; I divert myself with them as if they were romances which I could read by the power of vision within me . As I have never overtaxed my constitution , I still enjoy robust health ; and as my mind is endowed with all the force that I have not wasted , this head of mine is even better furnished than my galleries . The true millions lie here , "
12976	13144	13145	13145	he	990	" I spend delicious days in communings with the past ; I summon before me whole countries , places , extents of sea , the fair faces of history . In my imaginary seraglio I have all the women that I have never possessed . Your wars and revolutions come up before me for judgment . What is a feverish fugitive admiration for some more or less brightly colored piece of flesh and blood ; some more or less rounded human form ; what are all the disasters that wait on your erratic whims , compared with the magnificent power of conjuring up the whole world within your soul , compared with the immeasurable joys of movement , unstrangled by the cords of time , unclogged by the fetters of space ; the joys of beholding all things , of comprehending all things , of leaning over the parapet of the world to question the other spheres , to hearken to the voice of God ? There , "
13151	13165	13166	13166	he	990	" there are To Will and To have your Will , both together , "
13174	13274	13166	13166	he	990	" there are your social ideas , your immoderate desires , your excesses , your pleasures that end in death , your sorrows that quicken the pace of life , for pain is perhaps but a violent pleasure . Who could determine the point where pleasure becomes pain , where pain is still a pleasure ? Is not the utmost brightness of the ideal world soothing to us , while the lightest shadows of the physical world annoy ? Is not knowledge the secret of wisdom ? And what is folly but a riotous expenditure of Will or Power ? "
13275	13288	13290	13291	the stranger	502	" Very good then , a life of riotous excess for me ! "
13300	13306	13308	13309	the other	855	" Young man , beware ! "
13314	13325	13326	13327	the stranger	502	" I had resolved my existence into thought and study , "
13330	13385	13386	13386	he	502	" and yet they have not even supported me . I am not to be gulled by a sermon worthy of Swedenborg , nor by your Oriental amulet , nor yet by your charitable endeavors to keep me in a world wherein existence is no longer possible for me .... Let me see now , "
13402	13648	13395	13395	he	502	" I wish for a royal banquet , a carouse worthy of this century , which , it is said , has brought everything to perfection ! Let me have young boon companions , witty , unwarped by prejudice , merry to the verge of madness ! Let one wine succeed another , each more biting and perfumed than the last , and strong enough to bring about three days of delirium ! Passionate women 's forms should grace that night ! I would be borne away to unknown regions beyond the confines of this world , by the car and four - winged steed of a frantic and uproarious orgy . Let us ascend to the skies , or plunge ourselves in the mire . I do not know if one soars or sinks at such moments , and I do not care ! Next , I bid this enigmatical power to concentrate all delights for me in one single joy . Yes , I must comprehend every pleasure of earth and heaven in the final embrace that is to kill me . Therefore , after the wine , I wish to hold high festival to Priapus , with songs that might rouse the dead , and kisses without end ; the sound of them should pass like the crackling of flame through Paris , should revive the heat of youth and passion in husband and wife , even in hearts of seventy years . "
13683	13860	13678	13678	He	494	" Do you imagine that my floors are going to open suddenly , so that luxuriously - appointed tables may rise through them , and guests from another world ? No , no , young madcap . You have entered into the compact now , and there is an end of it . Henceforward , your wishes will be accurately fulfilled , but at the expense of your life . The compass of your days , visible in that skin , will contract according to the strength and number of your desires , from the least to the most extravagant . The Brahmin from whom I had this skin once explained to me that it would bring about a mysterious connection between the fortunes and wishes of its possessor . Your first wish is a vulgar one , which I could fulfil , but I leave that to the issues of your new existence . After all , you were wishing to die ; very well , your suicide is only put off for a time . "
13897	13992	13894	13894	he	998	" I shall soon see , sir , if any change comes over my fortunes in the time it will take to cross the width of the quay . But I should like us to be quits for such a momentous service ; that is , if you are not laughing at an unlucky wretch , so I wish that you may fall in love with an opera - dancer . You would understand the pleasures of intemperance then , and might perhaps grow lavish of the wealth that you have husbanded so philosophically . "
14120	14123	14209	14211	the young man	493	" Brute ! "
14124	14127	14209	14211	the young man	493	" Idiot ! "
14137	14144	14209	14211	the young man	493	" Why , it is Raphael ! "
14145	14154	14209	14211	the young man	493	" Good ! we were looking for you . "
14155	14164	14209	14211	the young man	493	" What ! it is you , then ? "
14196	14207	14209	14211	the young man	493	" My dear fellow , you must come with us ! "
14220	14227	14265	14265	they	1008	" What is all this about ? "
14228	14245	14209	14211	the young man	493	" Come along , and I will tell you the history of it as we go . "
14280	14291	14292	14293	the speaker	1011	" We have been after you for about a week , "
14297	14569	14292	14293	the speaker	1011	" At your respectable hotel _ de Saint Quentin _ , where , by the way , the sign with the alternate black and red letters can not be removed , and hangs out just as it did in the time of Jean Jacques , that Leonarda of yours told us that you were off into the country . For all that , we certainly did not look like duns , creditors , sheriff 's officers , or the like . But no matter ! Rastignac had seen you the evening before at the Bouffons ; we took courage again , and made it a point of honor to find out whether you were roosting in a tree in the Champs - Elysees , or in one of those philanthropic abodes where the beggars sleep on a twopenny rope , or if , more luckily , you were bivouacking in some boudoir or other . We could not find you anywhere . Your name was not in the jailers ' registers at the St. Pelagie nor at La Force ! Government departments , cafes , libraries , lists of prefects ' names , newspaper offices , restaurants , greenrooms -- to cut it short , every lurking place in Paris , good or bad , has been explored in the most expert manner . We bewailed the loss of a man endowed with such genius , that one might look to find him at Court or in the common jails . We talked of canonizing you as a hero of July , and , upon my word , we regretted you ! "
14642	14648	14650	14651	his friend	1017	" We really regretted you , "
14658	15242	14650	14651	his friend	1017	" It was a question of a plan in which we included you as a superior person , that is to say , somebody who can put himself above other people . The constitutional thimble - rig is carried on to - day , dear boy , more seriously than ever . The infamous monarchy , displaced by the heroism of the people , was a sort of drab , you could laugh and revel with her ; but La Patrie is a shrewish and virtuous wife , and willy - nilly you must take her prescribed endearments . Then besides , as you know , authority passed over from the Tuileries to the journalists , at the time when the Budget changed its quarters and went from the Faubourg Saint - Germain to the Chaussee de Antin . But this you may not know perhaps . The Government , that is , the aristocracy of lawyers and bankers who represent the country to - day , just as the priests used to do in the time of the monarchy , has felt the necessity of mystifying the worthy people of France with a few new words and old ideas , like philosophers of every school , and all strong intellects ever since time began . So now Royalist - national ideas must be inculcated , by proving to us that it is far better to pay twelve million francs , thirty - three centimes to La Patrie , represented by Messieurs Such - and - Such , than to pay eleven hundred million francs , nine centimes to a king who used to say _ I _ instead of _ we _ . In a word , a journal , with two or three hundred thousand francs , good , at the back of it , has just been started , with a view to making an opposition paper to content the discontented , without prejudice to the national government of the citizen - king . We scoff at liberty as at despotism now , and at religion or incredulity quite impartially . And since , for us , ' our country ' means a capital where ideas circulate and are sold at so much a line , a succulent dinner every day , and the play at frequent intervals , where profligate women swarm , where suppers last on into the next day , and light loves are hired by the hour like cabs ; and since Paris will always be the most adorable of all countries , the country of joy , liberty , wit , pretty women , _ mauvais sujets _ , and good wine ; where the truncheon of authority never makes itself disagreeably felt , because one is so close to those who wield it,--we , therefore , sectaries of the god Mephistopheles , have engaged to whitewash the public mind , to give fresh costumes to the actors , to put a new plank or two in the government booth , to doctor doctrinaires , and warm up old Republicans , to touch up the Bonapartists a bit , and revictual the Centre ; provided that we are allowed to laugh _ in petto _ at both kings and peoples , to think one thing in the morning and another at night , and to lead a merry life _ a la _ Panurge , or to recline upon soft cushions , _ more orientali _ .
15243	15253	15254	15254	he	1018	" The sceptre of this burlesque and macaronic kingdom , "
15258	15517	15254	15254	he	1018	" we have reserved for you ; so we are taking you straightway to a dinner given by the founder of the said newspaper , a retired banker , who , at a loss to know what to do with his money , is going to buy some brains with it . You will be welcomed as a brother , we shall hail you as king of these free lances who will undertake anything ; whose perspicacity discovers the intentions of Austria , England , or Russia before either Russia , Austria or England have formed any . Yes , we will invest you with the sovereignty of those puissant intellects which give to the world its Mirabeaus , Talleyrands , Pitts , and Metternichs -- all the clever Crispins who treat the destinies of a kingdom as gamblers ' stakes , just as ordinary men play dominoes for _ kirschenwasser _ . We have given you out to be the most undaunted champion who ever wrestled in a drinking - bout at close quarters with the monster called Carousal , whom all bold spirits wish to try a fall with ; we have gone so far as to say that you have never yet been worsted . I hope you will not make liars of us . Taillefer , our amphitryon , has undertaken to surpass the circumscribed saturnalias of the petty modern Lucullus . He is rich enough to infuse pomp into trifles , and style and charm into dissipation ... Are you listening , Raphael ? "
15525	15528	15530	15532	the young man	493	" Yes , "
15575	15593	15595	15598	one of his neighbors	1021	" Yes , you say , just as if you were thinking of your grandfather 's demise , "
15600	15603	15605	15605	Raphael	360	" Ah ! "

15652	15808	15635	15635	his	360	" So far our blasphemies have been uttered over our cups ; we have passed our judgments on life while drunk , and taken men and affairs in an after - dinner frame of mind . We were innocent of action ; we were bold in words . But now we are to be branded with the hot iron of politics ; we are going to enter the convict 's prison and to drop our illusions . Although one has no belief left , except in the devil , one may regret the paradise of one 's youth and the age of innocence , when we devoutly offered the tip of our tongue to some good priest for the consecrated wafer of the sacrament . Ah , my good friends , our first peccadilloes gave us so much pleasure because the consequent remorse set them off and lent a keen relish to them ; but nowadays---- "
15809	15814	15816	15818	the first speaker	1024	" Oh ! now , "
15820	15825	15816	15818	the first speaker	1024	" there is still left---- "
15826	15829	15831	15831	another	1025	" What ? "

15856	16020	15635	15635	his	360	" Oh , you do n't understand me ; I mean political crime . Since this morning , a conspirator 's life is the only one I covet . I do n't know that the fancy will last over to - morrow , but to - night at least my gorge rises at the anaemic life of our civilization and its railroad evenness . I am seized with a passion for the miseries of retreat from Moscow , for the excitements of the Red Corsair , or for a smuggler 's life . I should like to go to Botany Bay , as we have no Chartreaux left us here in France ; it is a sort of infirmary reserved for little Lord Byrons who , having crumpled up their lives like a serviette after dinner , have nothing left to do but to set their country ablaze , blow their own brains out , plot for a republic or clamor for a war---- "
16021	16024	16025	16025	Raphael	360	" Emile , "
16034	16068	16031	16032	the speaker	1011	" on my honor , but for the revolution of July I would have taken orders , and gone off down into the country somewhere to lead the life of an animal , and---- "
16069	16081	15635	15635	his	360	" And you would have read your breviary through every day . "
16082	16085	16031	16032	the speaker	1011	" Yes . "
16086	16092	15635	15635	his	360	" You are a coxcomb ! "
16093	16104	16031	16032	the speaker	1011	" Why , we read the newspapers as it is ! "
16105	16148	15635	15635	his	360	" Not bad that , for a journalist ! But hold your tongue , we are going through a crowd of subscribers . Journalism , look you , is the religion of modern society , and has even gone a little further . "
16149	16155	16031	16032	the speaker	1011	" What do you mean ? "
16156	16173	15635	15635	his	360	" Its pontiffs are not obliged to believe in it any more than the people are . "
16387	16409	16410	16410	he	248	" In the language of Maitre Alcofribas , we are about to make a famous _ troncon de chiere lie _ , "

16448	16469	16445	16445	Raphael	360	" Luxury in the peristyle is not common in France . I feel as if life had begun anew here . "
16470	16493	16494	16494	he	248	" And up above we are going to drink and make merry once more , my dear Raphael . Ah ! yes , "
16498	16520	16494	16494	he	248	" and I hope we are going to come off conquerors , too , and walk over everybody else 's head . "
17263	17293	17294	17294	he	360	" An income of a hundred thousand livres a year is a very nice beginning of the catechism , and a wonderful assistance to putting morality into our actions , "
17299	17382	17294	17294	he	360	" Truly my sort of virtue can scarcely go afoot , and vice means , to my thinking , a garret , a threadbare coat , a gray hat in winter time , and sums owing to the porter .... I should like to live in the lap of luxury a year , or six months , no matter ! And then afterwards , die . I should have known , exhausted , and consumed a thousand lives , at any rate . "
17383	17398	17400	17400	Emile	248	" Why , you are taking the tone of a stockbroker in good luck , "
17406	17478	17479	17479	he	360	" Pooh ! your riches would be a burden to you as soon as you found that they would spoil your chances of coming out above the rest of us . Has n't the artist always kept the balance true between the poverty of riches and the riches of poverty ? And is n't struggle a necessity to some of us ? Look out for your digestion , and only look , "
17489	17768	17479	17479	he	360	" at the majestic , thrice holy , and edifying appearance of this amiable capitalist 's dining - room . That man has in reality only made his money for our benefit . Is n't he a kind of sponge of the polyp order , overlooked by naturalists , which should be carefully squeezed before he is left for his heirs to feed upon ? There is style , is n't there , about those bas - reliefs that adorn the walls ? And the lustres , and the pictures , what luxury well carried out ! If one may believe those who envy him , or who know , or think they know , the origins of his life , then this man got rid of a German and some others -- his best friend for one , and the mother of that friend , during the Revolution . Could you house crimes under the venerable Taillefer 's silvering locks ? He looks to me a very worthy man . Only see how the silver sparkles , and is every glittering ray like a stab of a dagger to him ? ... Let us go in , one might as well believe in Mahomet . If common report speak truth , here are thirty men of talent , and good fellows too , prepared to dine off the flesh and blood of a whole family ; ... and here are we ourselves , a pair of youngsters full of open - hearted enthusiasm , and we shall be partakers in his guilt . I have a mind to ask our capitalist whether he is a respectable character .... "
17769	17775	17777	17777	Raphael	360	" No , not now , "
17779	17795	17777	17777	Raphael	360	" but when he is dead drunk , we shall have had our dinner then . "

18659	18665	18667	18667	Emile	248	" What stuff is this ? "
18671	18785	18667	18667	Emile	248	" plain Valentin , say you ? Raphael DE Valentin , if you please . We bear an eagle or , on a field sable , with a silver crown , beak and claws gules , and a fine motto : NON CECIDIT ANIMUS . We are no foundling child , but a descendant of the Emperor Valens , of the stock of the Valentinois , founders of the cities of Valence in France , and Valencia in Spain , rightful heirs to the Empire of the East . If we suffer Mahmoud on the throne of Byzantium , it is out of pure condescension , and for lack of funds and soldiers . "

19236	19279	19189	19190	the Republican	2797	" Eh , sir ! the man who feels compunction is your thorough scoundrel , for he has some notion of virtue ; while Peter the Great and the Duke of Alva were embodied systems , and the pirate Monbard an organization . "
19280	19293	19295	19295	Canalis	271	" But ca n't society rid itself of your systems and organizations ? "
19297	19302	19304	19305	the Republican	2797	" Oh , granted ! "
19307	19339	19189	19190	the Republican	2797	" That stupid Republic of yours makes me feel queasy . We sha'n't be able to carve a capon in peace , because we shall find the agrarian law inside it . "
19340	19396	19189	19190	the Republican	2797	" Ah , my little Brutus , stuffed with truffles , your principles are all right enough . But you are like my valet , the rogue is so frightfully possessed with a mania for property that if I left him to clean my clothes after his fashion , he would soon clean me out . "

19458	19495	19454	19456	the notary Cardot	273	" Shut up . That 's enough of it . There is no knowledge nor virtue worth shedding a drop of blood for . If Truth were brought into liquidation , we might find her insolvent . "
19496	19550	19403	19404	the Republican	2797	" It would be much less trouble , no doubt , to amuse ourselves with evil , rather than dispute about good . Moreover , I would give all the speeches made for forty years past at the Tribune for a trout , for one of Perrault 's tales or Charlet 's sketches . "
19551	19625	19454	19456	the notary Cardot	273	" Quite right ! ... Hand me the asparagus . Because , after all , liberty begets anarchy , anarchy leads to despotism , and despotism back again to liberty . Millions have died without securing a triumph for any one system . Is not that the vicious circle in which the whole moral world revolves ? Man believes that he has reached perfection , when in fact he has but rearranged matters . "

19783	19824	19633	19633	Cursy	278	" The first inventor of ditches must have been a weakling , for society is only useful to the puny . The savage and the philosopher , at either extreme of the moral scale , hold property in equal horror . "

19896	19905	19832	19832	Cardot	273	" Could you bear his loss with resignation ? "
19906	19910	19633	19633	Cursy	278	" No question . "
19911	19931	19832	19832	Cardot	273	" Gentlemen , listen to me ! _ How to kill an uncle _ . Silence ! ( Cries of "
19936	19982	19832	19832	Cardot	273	" ) In the first place , take an uncle , large and stout , seventy years old at least , they are the best uncles . ( Sensation . ) Get him to eat a pate de foie gras , any pretext will do . "
19983	20002	19633	19633	Cursy	278	" Ah , but my uncle is a thin , tall man , and very niggardly and abstemious . "
20003	20016	19832	19832	Cardot	273	" That sort of uncle is a monster ; he misappropriates existence . "
20017	20020	19633	19633	Cursy	278	" Then , "
20028	20044	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" tell him , while he is digesting it , that his banker has failed . "
20045	20052	19633	19633	Cursy	278	" How if he bears up ? "
20053	20062	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" Let loose a pretty girl on him . "
20063	20067	20069	20070	the other	855	" And if---- ? "
20079	20097	19832	19832	Cardot	273	" Then he would n't be an uncle -- an uncle is a gay dog by nature . "
20098	20108	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" Malibran has lost two notes in her voice . "
20109	20118	19832	19832	Cardot	273	" No , sir , she has not . "

20128	20166	19832	19832	Cardot	273	" Oh , ho ! No and yes , is not that the sum - up of all religious , political , or literary dissertations ? Man is a clown dancing on the edge of an abyss . "

20192	20346	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" Education , there 's a pretty piece of tomfoolery . M. Heineffettermach estimates the number of printed volumes at more than a thousand millions ; and a man can not read more than a hundred and fifty thousand in his lifetime . So , just tell me what that word _ education _ means . For some it consists in knowing the name of Alexander 's horse , of the dog Berecillo , of the Seigneur d'Accords , and in ignorance of the man to whom we owe the discovery of rafting and the manufacture of porcelain . For others it is the knowledge how to burn a will and live respected , be looked up to and popular , instead of stealing a watch with half - a - dozen aggravating circumstances , after a previous conviction , and so perishing , hated and dishonored , in the Place de Greve . "
20347	20354	19832	19832	Cardot	273	" Will Nathan 's work live ? "
20355	20364	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" He has very clever collaborators , sir . "

20393	20465	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" The consequence of a Constitution is the immediate stultification of intellects . Art , science , public works , everything , is consumed by a horribly egoistic feeling , the leprosy of the time . Three hundred of your bourgeoisie , set down on benches , will only think of planting poplars . Tyranny does great things lawlessly , while Liberty will scarcely trouble herself to do petty ones lawfully . "
20466	20478	19832	19832	Cardot	273	" Your reciprocal instruction will turn out counters in human flesh , "

20528	20628	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" If you had an income of fifty thousand livres , you would not think much about the people . If you are smitten with a tender passion for the race , go to Madagascar ; there you will find a nice little nation all ready to Saint - Simonize , classify , and cork up in your phials , but here every one fits into his niche like a peg in a hole . A porter is a porter , and a blockhead is a fool , without a college of fathers to promote them to those positions . "
20629	20635	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" You are a Carlist . "
20636	20688	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" And why not ? Despotism pleases me ; it implies a certain contempt for the human race . I have no animosity against kings , they are so amusing . Is it nothing to sit enthroned in a room , at a distance of thirty million leagues from the sun ? "
20689	20701	20021	20024	the speaker on uncles	1136	" Let us once more take a broad view of civilization , "
20728	20894	20703	20715	the man of learning who , for the benefit of the inattentive sculptor	1139	" The vigor of a nation in its origin was in a way physical , unitary , and crude ; then as aggregations increased , government advanced by a decomposition of the primitive rule , more or less skilfully managed . For example , in remote ages national strength lay in theocracy , the priest held both sword and censer ; a little later there were two priests , the pontiff and the king . To - day our society , the latest word of civilization , has distributed power according to the number of combinations , and we come to the forces called business , thought , money , and eloquence . Authority thus divided is steadily approaching a social dissolution , with interest as its one opposing barrier . We depend no longer on either religion or physical force , but upon intellect . Can a book replace the sword ? Can discussion be a substitute for action ? That is the question . "
20895	20904	20906	20907	the Carlist	288	" Intellect has made an end of everything , "
20909	20932	20906	20907	the Carlist	288	" Come now ! Absolute freedom has brought about national suicides ; their triumph left them as listless as an English millionaire . "
20933	21007	20703	20715	the man of learning who , for the benefit of the inattentive sculptor	1139	" Wo n't you tell us something new ? You have made fun of authority of all sorts to - day , which is every bit as vulgar as denying the existence of God . So you have no belief left , and the century is like an old Sultan worn out by debauchery ! Your Byron , in short , sings of crime and its emotions in a final despair of poetry . "

21146	21153	21068	21068	Cursy	278	" What a flash of wit ! "
21154	21159	21161	21163	a young man	478	" Drunk as lords , "
21175	21191	21068	21068	Cursy	278	" Yes , sir ; real government is the art of ruling by public opinion . "
21192	21271	21068	21068	Cursy	278	" Opinion ? That is the most vicious jade of all . According to you moralists and politicians , the laws you set up are always to go before those of nature , and opinion before conscience . You are right and wrong both . Suppose society bestows down pillows on us , that benefit is made up for by the gout ; and justice is likewise tempered by red - tape , and colds accompany cashmere shawls . "
21272	21275	21068	21068	Cursy	278	" Wretch ! "
21283	21323	21276	21276	Emile	248	" how can you slander civilization here at table , up to the eyes in wines and exquisite dishes ? Eat away at that roebuck with the gilded horns and feet , and do not carp at your mother ... "
21324	21374	21068	21068	Cursy	278	" Is it any fault of mine if Catholicism puts a million deities in a sack of flour , that Republics will end in a Napoleon , that monarchy dwells between the assassination of Henry IV . and the trial of Louis XVI . , and Liberalism produces Lafayettes ? "

21385	21388	21068	21068	Cursy	278	" No . "
21389	21398	21276	21276	Emile	248	" Then hold your tongue , you sceptic . "
21399	21408	21068	21068	Cursy	278	" Sceptics are the most conscientious of men . "
21409	21415	21276	21276	Emile	248	" They have no conscience . "
21416	21429	21068	21068	Cursy	278	" What are you saying ? They have two apiece at least ! "
21430	21469	21276	21276	Emile	248	" So you want to discount heaven , a thoroughly commercial notion . Ancient religions were but the unchecked development of physical pleasure , but we have developed a soul and expectations ; some advance has been made . "
21470	21488	21490	21490	Nathan	284	" What can you expect , my friends , of a century filled with politics to repletion ? "
21492	21515	21490	21490	Nathan	284	" What befell _ The History of the King of Bohemia and his Seven Castles _ , a most entrancing conception ? ... "
21516	21520	21276	21276	Emile	248	" I say , "
21535	21561	21276	21276	Emile	248	" The phrases might have been drawn at hap - hazard from a hat , ' twas a work written ' down to Charenton . ' "
21562	21568	21276	21276	Emile	248	" You are a fool ! "
21569	21576	21276	21276	Emile	248	" And you are a rogue ! "
21577	21582	21276	21276	Emile	248	" Oh ! oh ! "
21583	21588	21276	21276	Emile	248	" Ah ! ah ! "
21589	21596	21276	21276	Emile	248	" They are going to fight . "
21597	21604	21276	21276	Emile	248	" No , they are n't . "
21605	21616	21276	21276	Emile	248	" You will find me to - morrow , sir . "
21617	21622	21623	21623	Nathan	284	" This very moment , "
21626	21638	21276	21276	Emile	248	" Come , come , you pair of fire - eaters ! "
21639	21644	21646	21651	the prime mover in the quarrel	1142	" You are another ! "
21653	21664	21668	21668	Nathan	284	" Ah , I ca n't stand upright , perhaps ? "
21709	21717	21718	21719	the critic	1143	" Would it not have been nice , "
21725	21738	21718	21719	the critic	1143	" to fight about a book I have neither read nor seen ? "
21739	21754	21756	21756	Bixiou	269	" Emile , look out for your coat ; your neighbor is growing pale , "
21758	21866	21718	21719	the critic	1143	" Kant ? Yet another ball flung out for fools to sport with , sir ! Materialism and spiritualism are a fine pair of battledores with which charlatans in long gowns keep a shuttlecock a - going . Suppose that God is everywhere , as Spinoza says , or that all things proceed from God , as says St. Paul ... the nincompoops , the door shuts or opens , but is n't the movement the same ? Does the fowl come from the egg , or the egg from the fowl ? ... Just hand me some duck ... and there , you have all science . "
21867	21870	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Simpleton ! "
21877	21885	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" your problem is settled by fact ! "
21886	21890	21718	21719	the critic	1143	" What fact ? "
21891	21920	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Professors ' chairs were not made for philosophy , but philosophy for the professors ' chairs . Put on a pair of spectacles and read the budget . "
21921	21924	21718	21719	the critic	1143	" Thieves ! "
21925	21928	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Nincompoops ! "
21929	21932	21718	21719	the critic	1143	" Knaves ! "
21933	21936	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Gulls ! "
21937	21954	21956	21956	Bixiou	269	" Where but in Paris will you find such a ready and rapid exchange of thought ? "
21964	21977	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Bixiou ! Act a classical farce for us ! Come now . "
21978	21989	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Would you like me to depict the nineteenth century ? "
21990	21993	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Silence . "
21994	21998	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Pay attention . "
21999	22007	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Clap a muffle on your trumpets . "
22008	22015	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Shut up , you Turk ! "
22016	22029	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Give him some wine , and let that fellow keep quiet . "
22030	22037	21872	21875	the man of science	1145	" Now , then , Bixiou ! "
22604	22612	22613	22613	Emile	248	" Now , did you murder them ? "
22617	22637	22642	22642	his	246	" Capital punishment is going to be abolished , they say , in favor of the Revolution of July , "
22648	22661	22662	22662	Raphael	360	" Do n't they rise up before you in dreams at times ? "
22665	22673	22675	22676	the murderer	1169	" There 's a statute of limitations , "
22680	22686	22687	22687	Emile	248	" And on his tombstone , "
22695	22720	22721	22721	he	248	" the stonemason will carve ' Passer - by , accord a tear , in memory of one that 's here ! ' Oh , "
22724	22749	22721	22721	he	248	" I would cheerfully pay a hundred sous to any mathematician who would prove the existence of hell to me by an algebraical equation . "
22758	22766	22750	22750	He	248	" Heads for the existence of God ! "
22767	22772	22773	22773	Raphael	360	" Do n't look ! "
22780	22789	22773	22773	Raphael	360	" Who knows ? Suspense is so pleasant . "
22790	22793	22794	22794	Emile	248	" Unluckily , "
22801	22852	22794	22794	Emile	248	" I can see no halting - place between the unbeliever 's arithmetic and the papal _ Pater noster _ . Pshaw ! let us drink . _ Trinq _ was , I believe , the oracular answer of the _ dive bouteille _ and the final conclusion of Pantagruel . "
22853	22959	22773	22773	Raphael	360	" We owe our arts and monuments to the _ Pater noster _ , and our knowledge , too , perhaps ; and a still greater benefit -- modern government -- whereby a vast and teeming society is wondrously represented by some five hundred intellects . It neutralizes opposing forces and gives free play to _ Civilization _ , that Titan queen who has succeeded the ancient terrible figure of the _ King _ , that sham Providence , reared by man between himself and heaven . In the face of such achievements , atheism seems like a barren skeleton . What do you say ? "
22960	22973	22974	22974	Emile	248	" I am thinking of the seas of blood shed by Catholicism . "
22980	23044	22974	22974	Emile	248	" It has drained our hearts and veins dry to make a mimic deluge . No matter ! Every man who thinks must range himself beneath the banner of Christ , for He alone has consummated the triumph of spirit over matter ; He alone has revealed to us , like a poet , an intermediate world that separates us from the Deity . "
23045	23049	23051	23051	Raphael	360	" Believest thou ? "
23058	23081	23051	23051	Raphael	360	" Very good ; we must not commit ourselves ; so we will drink the celebrated toast , _ Diis ignotis _ ! "
23103	23121	23123	23126	the major - domo	1171	" If the gentlemen will go to the drawing - room , coffee is ready for them , "
24771	24777	24779	24779	Raphael	360	" What is your name ? "
24781	24784	24779	24779	Raphael	360	" Aquilina . "
24785	24793	24795	24795	Emile	248	" Out of _ Venice Preserved _ ! "
24797	24800	24801	24801	she	1212	" Yes , "
24804	24838	24801	24801	she	1212	" Just as a pope takes a new name when he is exalted above all other men , I , too , took another name when I raised myself above women 's level . "
24839	24864	24866	24866	Emile	248	" Then have you , like your patron saint , a terrible and noble lover , a conspirator , who would die for you ? "
24878	24883	24884	24884	she	1212	" Once I had , "
24887	24916	24884	24884	she	1212	" But I had a rival too in La Guillotine . I have worn something red about me ever since , lest any happiness should carry me away . "
24917	25012	24801	24801	she	1212	" Oh , if you are going to get her on to the story of those four lads of La Rochelle , she will never get to the end of it . That 's enough , Aquilina . As if every woman could not bewail some lover or other , though not every one has the luck to lose him on the scaffold , as you have done . I would a great deal sooner see a lover of mine in a trench at the back of Clamart than in a rival 's arms . "
25359	25367	25368	25368	Emile	248	" I should dearly like to know , "
25375	25384	25368	25368	Emile	248	" if you ever reflect upon your future ? "
25385	25389	25390	25390	she	1230	" My future ! "
25396	25457	25390	25390	she	1230	" What do you mean by my future ? Why should I think about something that does not exist as yet ? I never look before or behind . Is n't one day at a time more than I can concern myself with as it is ? And besides , the future , as we know , means the hospital . "
25458	25477	25368	25368	Emile	248	" How can you forsee a future in the hospital , and make no effort to avert it ? "
25478	25488	25490	25492	the terrific Aquilina	314	" What is there so alarming about the hospital ? "
25494	25753	25490	25492	the terrific Aquilina	314	" When we are neither wives nor mothers , when old age draws black stockings over our limbs , sets wrinkles on our brows , withers up the woman in us , and darkens the light in our lover 's eyes , what could we need when that comes to pass ? You would look on us then as mere human clay ; we with our habiliments shall be for you like so much mud -- worthless , lifeless , crumbling to pieces , going about with the rustle of dead leaves . Rags or the daintiest finery will be as one to us then ; the ambergris of the boudoir will breathe an odor of death and dry bones ; and suppose there is a heart there in that mud , not one of you but would make mock of it , not so much as a memory will you spare to us . Is not our existence precisely the same whether we live in a fine mansion with lap - dogs to tend , or sort rags in a workhouse ? Does it make much difference whether we shall hide our gray heads beneath lace or a handkerchief striped with blue and red ; whether we sweep a crossing with a birch broom , or the steps of the Tuileries with satins ; whether we sit beside a gilded hearth , or cower over the ashes in a red earthen pot ; whether we go to the Opera or look on in the Place de Greve ? "
25754	25774	25775	25775	Euphrasia	315	" _ Aquilina mia _ , you have never shown more sense than in this depressing fit of yours , "
25778	25829	25830	25830	she	315	" Yes , cashmere , _ point d'Alencon _ , perfumes , gold , silks , luxury , everything that sparkles , everything pleasant , belongs to youth alone . Time alone may show us our folly , but good fortune will acquit us . You are laughing at me , "
25842	25994	25830	25830	she	315	" but am I not right ? I would sooner die of pleasure than of illness . I am not afflicted with a mania for perpetuity , nor have I a great veneration for human nature , such as God has made it . Give me millions , and I would squander them ; I should not keep one centime for the year to come . Live to be charming and have power , that is the decree of my every heartbeat . Society sanctions my life ; does it not pay for my extravagances ? Why does Providence pay me every morning my income , which I spend every evening ? Why are hospitals built for us ? And Providence did not put good and evil on either hand for us to select what tires and pains us . I should be very foolish if I did not amuse myself . "
25995	26001	26003	26003	Emile	248	" And how about others ? "
26005	26041	25830	25830	she	315	" Others ? Oh , well , they must manage for themselves . I prefer laughing at their woes to weeping over my own . I defy any man to give me the slightest uneasiness . "
26042	26054	26056	26056	Raphael	360	" What have you suffered to make you think like this ? "
26058	26068	26069	26069	she	1246	" I myself have been forsaken for an inheritance , "
26081	26121	26069	26069	she	1246	" and yet I had worked night and day to keep my lover ! I am not to be gulled by any smile or vow , and I have set myself to make one long entertainment of my life . "
26122	26133	26135	26135	Raphael	360	" But does not happiness come from the soul within ? "
26137	26143	26144	26144	Aquilina	314	" It may be so , "
26147	26207	26144	26144	Aquilina	314	" but is it nothing to be conscious of admiration and flattery ; to triumph over other women , even over the most virtuous , humiliating them before our beauty and our splendor ? Not only so ; one day of our life is worth ten years of a bourgeoise existence , and so it is all summed up . "
26208	26217	26218	26218	Emile	248	" Is not a woman hateful without virtue ? "
26248	26270	26233	26233	she	1246	" Virtue ! we leave that to deformity and to ugly women . What would the poor things be without it ? "
26271	26277	26278	26278	Emile	248	" Hush , be quiet , "
26282	26293	26278	26278	Emile	248	" Do n't talk about something you have never known . "
26294	26301	26302	26302	Euphrasia	315	" That I have never known ! "
26305	26421	26302	26302	Euphrasia	315	" You give yourself for life to some person you abominate ; you must bring up children who will neglect you , who wound your very heart , and you must say , ' Thank you ! ' for it ; and these are the virtues you prescribe to woman . And that is not enough . By way of requiting her self - denial , you must come and add to her sorrows by trying to lead her astray ; and though you are rebuffed , she is compromised . A nice life ! How far better to keep one 's freedom , to follow one 's inclinations in love , and die young ! "
26422	26439	26278	26278	Emile	248	" Have you no fear of the price to be paid some day for all this ? "
26440	26444	26445	26445	she	1247	" Even then , "
26448	26492	26445	26445	she	1247	" instead of mingling pleasures and troubles , my life will consist of two separate parts -- a youth of happiness is secure , and there may come a hazy , uncertain old age , during which I can suffer at my leisure . "
26493	26499	26506	26506	Aquilina	314	" She has never loved , "
26510	26570	26506	26506	Aquilina	314	" She never went a hundred leagues to drink in one look and a denial with untold raptures . She has not hung her own life on a thread , nor tried to stab more than one man to save her sovereign lord , her king , her divinity .... Love , for her , meant a fascinating colonel . "
26571	26580	26581	26581	Euphrasia	315	" Here she is with her La Rochelle , "
26585	26624	26581	26581	Euphrasia	315	" Love comes like the wind , no one knows whence . And , for that matter , if one of those brutes had once fallen in love with you , you would hold sensible men in horror . "
26625	26637	26639	26643	the tall , sarcastic Aquilina	1248	" Brutes are put out of the question by the Code , "
26645	26656	26658	26658	Euphrasia	315	" I thought you had more kindness for the army , "
26660	26676	26677	26677	Raphael	360	" How happy they are in their power of dethroning their reason in this way , "
26680	26683	26685	26685	Aquilina	314	" Happy ? "
26700	26727	26685	26685	Aquilina	314	" Ah , you do not know what it is to be condemned to a life of pleasure , with your dead hidden in your heart .... "
27068	27084	27041	27044	The valet de chambre	1257	" The neighbors are all at their windows , complaining of the racket , sir . "
27085	27102	27104	27104	Taillefer	246	" If noise alarms them , why do n't they lay down straw before their doors ? "
27131	27138	27139	27139	he	360	" You will hardly understand me , "
27142	27305	27139	27139	he	360	" In the first place , I must admit that you stopped me on the Quai Voltaire just as I was about to throw myself into the Seine , and you would like to know , no doubt , my motives for dying . And when I proceed to tell you that by an almost miraculous chance the most poetic memorials of the material world had but just then been summed up for me as a symbolical interpretation of human wisdom ; whilst at this minute the remains of all the intellectual treasures ravaged by us at table are comprised in these two women , the living and authentic types of folly , would you be any the wiser ? Our profound apathy towards men and things supplied the half - tones in a crudely contrasted picture of two theories of life so diametrically opposed . If you were not drunk , you might perhaps catch a gleam of philosophy in this . "
27306	27335	27337	27337	Emile	248	" And if you had not both feet on that fascinating Aquilina , whose heavy breathing suggests an analogy with the sounds of a storm about to burst , "
27353	27491	27337	27337	Emile	248	" you would be ashamed of your inebriated garrulity . Both your systems can be packed in a phrase , and reduced to a single idea . The mere routine of living brings a stupid kind of wisdom with it , by blunting our intelligence with work ; and on the other hand , a life passed in the limbo of the abstract or in the abysses of the moral world , produces a sort of wisdom run mad . The conditions may be summed up in brief ; we may extinguish emotion , and so live to old age , or we may choose to die young as martyrs to contending passions . And yet this decree is at variance with the temperaments with which we were endowed by the bitter jester who modeled all creatures . "
27492	27495	27496	27496	Raphael	360	" Idiot ! "
27500	27606	27496	27496	Raphael	360	" Go on epitomizing yourself after that fashion , and you will fill volumes . If I attempted to formulate those two ideas clearly , I might as well say that man is corrupted by the exercise of his wits , and purified by ignorance . You are calling the whole fabric of society to account . But whether we live with the wise or perish with the fool , is n't the result the same sooner or later ? And have not the prime constituents of the quintessence of both systems been before expressed in a couple of words--_Carymary _ , _ Carymara _ . "
27607	27627	27629	27629	Emile	248	" You make me doubt the existence of a God , for your stupidity is greater than His power , "
27631	27756	27629	27629	Emile	248	" Our beloved Rabelais summed it all up in a shorter word than your ' _ Carymary _ , _ Carymara _ ' ; from his _ Peut - etre _ Montaigne derived his own _ Que sais - je _ ? After all , this last word of moral science is scarcely more than the cry of Pyrrhus set betwixt good and evil , or Buridan 's ass between the two measures of oats . But let this everlasting question alone , resolved to - day by a ' Yes ' and a ' No . ' What experience did you look to find by a jump into the Seine ? Were you jealous of the hydraulic machine on the Pont Notre Dame ? "
27757	27767	27496	27496	Raphael	360	" Ah , if you but knew my history ! "
27768	27771	27773	27773	Emile	248	" Pooh , "
27775	27810	27773	27773	Emile	248	" I did not think you could be so commonplace ; that remark is hackneyed . Do n't you know that every one of us claims to have suffered as no other ever did ? "
27811	27814	27815	27815	Raphael	360	" Ah ! "
27818	28035	27815	27815	Raphael	360	" What a mountebank art thou with thy ' Ah ' ! Look here , now . Does some disease of the mind or body , by contracting your muscles , bring back of a morning the wild horses that tear you in pieces at night , as with Damiens once upon a time ? Were you driven to sup off your own dog in a garret , uncooked and without salt ? Have your children ever cried , ' I am hungry ' ? Have you sold your mistress ' hair to hazard the money at play ? Have you ever drawn a sham bill of exchange on a fictitious uncle at a sham address , and feared lest you should not be in time to take it up ? Come now , I am attending ! If you were going to drown yourself for some woman , or by way of a protest , or out of sheer dulness , I disown you . Make your confession , and no lies ! I do n't at all want a historical memoir . And , above all things , be as concise as your clouded intellect permits ; I am as critical as a professor , and as sleepy as a woman at her vespers . "
28036	28041	28043	28043	Raphael	360	" You silly fool ! "
28045	28142	28043	28043	Raphael	360	" When has not suffering been keener for a more susceptible nature ? Some day when science has attained to a pitch that enables us to study the natural history of hearts , when they are named and classified in genera , sub - genera , and families ; into crustaceae , fossils , saurians , infusoria , or whatever it is,--then , my dear fellow , it will be ascertained that there are natures as tender and fragile as flowers , that are broken by the slight bruises that some stony hearts do not even feel---- "
28143	28154	28156	28156	Emile	248	" For pity 's sake , spare me thy exordium , "
28192	28338	28185	28185	Raphael	360	" Perhaps it is an effect of the fumes of punch -- I really can not tell -- this clearness of mind that enables me to comprise my whole life in a single picture , where figures and hues , lights , shades , and half - tones are faithfully rendered . I should not have been so surprised at this poetical play of imagination if it were not accompanied with a sort of scorn for my past joys and sorrows . Seen from afar , my life appears to contract by some mental process . That long , slow agony of ten years ' duration can be brought to memory to - day in some few phrases , in which pain is resolved into a mere idea , and pleasure becomes a philosophical reflection . Instead of feeling things , I weigh and consider them---- "
28339	28351	28353	28353	Emile	248	" You are as tiresome as the explanation of an amendment , "
28355	28359	28361	28361	Raphael	360	" Very likely , "
28364	28467	28361	28361	Raphael	360	" I spare you the first seventeen years of my life for fear of abusing a listener 's patience . Till that time , like you and thousands of others , I had lived my life at school or the lycee , with its imaginary troubles and genuine happinesses , which are so pleasant to look back upon . Our jaded palates still crave for that Lenten fare , so long as we have not tried it afresh . It was a pleasant life , with the tasks that we thought so contemptible , but which taught us application for all that .... "
28468	28474	28476	28476	Emile	248	" Let the drama begin , "
28486	28492	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" When I left school , "
28507	28604	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" my father submitted me to a strict discipline ; he installed me in a room near his own study , and I had to rise at five in the morning and be in bed by nine at night . He meant me to take my law studies seriously . I attended the Schools , and read with an advocate as well , but my lectures and work were so narrowly circumscribed by the laws of time and space , and my father required such a strict account of my doings , at dinner , that ... "
28605	28612	28614	28614	Emile	248	" What is this to me ? "
28616	28622	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" The devil take you ! "
28626	28790	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" How are you to enter into my feelings if I do not relate the facts that insensibly shaped my character , made me timid , and prolonged the period of youthful simplicity ? In this manner I cowered under as strict a despotism as a monarch 's till I came of age . To depict the tedium of my life , it will be perhaps enough to portray my father to you . He was tall , thin , and slight , with a hatchet face , and pale complexion ; a man of few words , fidgety as an old maid , exacting as a senior clerk . His paternal solicitude hovered over my merriment and gleeful thoughts , and seemed to cover them with a leaden pall . Any effusive demonstration on my part was received by him as a childish absurdity . I was far more afraid of him than I had been of any of our masters at school .
28791	29124	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" I seem to see him before me at this moment . In his chestnut - brown frock - coat he looked like a red herring wrapped up in the cover of a pamphlet , and he held himself as erect as an Easter candle . But I was fond of my father , and at heart he was right enough . Perhaps we never hate severity when it has its source in greatness of character and pure morals , and is skilfully tempered with kindness . My father , it is true , never left me a moment to myself , and only when I was twenty years old gave me so much as ten francs of my own , ten knavish prodigals of francs , such a hoard as I had long vainly desired , which set me a - dreaming of unutterable felicity ; yet , for all that he sought to procure relaxations for me . When he had promised me a treat beforehand , he would take me to Les Boufoons , or to a concert or ball , where I hoped to find a mistress .... A mistress ! that meant independence . But bashful and timid as I was , knowing nobody , and ignorant of the dialect of drawing - rooms , I always came back as awkward as ever , and swelling with unsatisfied desires , to be put in harness like a troop horse next day by my father , and to return with morning to my advocate , the Palais de Justice , and the law . To have swerved from the straight course which my father had mapped out for me , would have drawn down his wrath upon me ; at my first delinquency , he threatened to ship me off as a cabin - boy to the Antilles . A dreadful shiver ran through me if I had ventured to spend a couple of hours in some pleasure party .
29125	29258	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" Imagine the most wandering imagination and passionate temperament , the tenderest soul and most artistic nature , dwelling continually in the presence of the most flint - hearted , atrabilious , and frigid man on earth ; think of me as a young girl married to a skeleton , and you will understand the life whose curious scenes can only be a hearsay tale to you ; the plans for running away that perished at the sight of my father , the despair soothed by slumber , the dark broodings charmed away by music . I breathed my sorrows forth in melodies . Beethoven or Mozart would keep my confidences sacred . Nowadays , I smile at recollections of the scruples which burdened my conscience at that epoch of innocence and virtue .
29259	29633	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" If I set foot in a restaurant , I gave myself up for lost ; my fancy led me to look on a cafe as a disreputable haunt , where men lost their characters and embarrassed their fortunes ; as for engaging in play , I had not the money to risk . Oh , if I needed to send you to sleep , I would tell you about one of the most frightful pleasures of my life , one of those pleasures with fangs that bury themselves in the heart as the branding - iron enters the convict 's shoulder . I was at a ball at the house of the Duc de Navarreins , my father 's cousin . But to make my position the more perfectly clear , you must know that I wore a threadbare coat , ill - fitting shoes , a tie fit for a stableman , and a soiled pair of gloves . I shrank into a corner to eat ices and watch the pretty faces at my leisure . My father noticed me . Actuated by some motive that I did not fathom , so dumfounded was I by this act of confidence , he handed me his keys and purse to keep . Ten paces away some men were gambling . I heard the rattling of gold ; I was twenty years old ; I longed to be steeped for one whole day in the follies of my time of life . It was a license of the imagination that would find a parallel neither in the freaks of courtesans , nor in the dreams of young girls . For a year past I had beheld myself well dressed , in a carriage , with a pretty woman by my side , playing the great lord , dining at Very 's , deciding not to go back home till the morrow ; but was prepared for my father with a plot more intricate than the Marriage of Figaro , which he could not possibly have unraveled . All this bliss would cost , I estimated , fifty crowns . Was it not the artless idea of playing truant that still had charms for me ?
29634	29902	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" I went into a small adjoining room , and when alone counted my father 's money with smarting eyes and trembling fingers -- a hundred crowns ! The joys of my escapade rose before me at the thought of the amount ; joys that flitted about me like Macbeth 's witches round their caldron ; joys how alluring ! how thrilling ! how delicious ! I became a deliberate rascal . I heeded neither my tingling ears nor the violent beating of my heart , but took out two twenty - franc pieces that I seem to see yet . The dates had been erased , and Bonaparte 's head simpered upon them . After I had put back the purse in my pocket , I returned to the gaming - table with the two pieces of gold in the palms of my damp hands , prowling about the players like a sparrow - hawk round a coop of chickens . Tormented by inexpressible terror , I flung a sudden clairvoyant glance round me , and feeling quite sure that I was seen by none of my acquaintance , betted on a stout , jovial little man , heaping upon his head more prayers and vows than are put up during two or three storms at sea . Then , with an intuitive scoundrelism , or Machiavelism , surprising in one of my age , I went and stood in the door , and looked about me in the rooms , though I saw nothing ; for both mind and eyes hovered about that fateful green cloth .
29903	30088	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" That evening fixes the date of a first observation of a physiological kind ; to it I owe a kind of insight into certain mysteries of our double nature that I have since been enabled to penetrate . I had my back turned on the table where my future felicity lay at stake , a felicity but so much the more intense that it was criminal . Between me and the players stood a wall of onlookers some five feet deep , who were chatting ; the murmur of voices drowned the clinking of gold , which mingled in the sounds sent up by this orchestra ; yet , despite all obstacles , I distinctly heard the words of the two players by a gift accorded to the passions , which enables them to annihilate time and space . I saw the points they made ; I knew which of the two turned up the king as well as if I had actually seen the cards ; at a distance of ten paces , in short , the fortunes of play blanched my face .
30089	30341	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" My father suddenly went by , and then I knew what the Scripture meant by ' The Spirit of God passed before his face . ' I had won . I slipped through the crowd of men who had gathered about the players with the quickness of an eel escaping through a broken mesh in a net . My nerves thrilled with joy instead of anguish . I felt like some criminal on the way to torture released by a chance meeting with the king . It happened that a man with a decoration found himself short by forty francs . Uneasy eyes suspected me ; I turned pale , and drops of perspiration stood on my forehead , I was well punished , I thought , for having robbed my father . Then the kind little stout man said , in a voice like an angel 's surely , ' All these gentlemen have paid their stakes , ' and put down the forty francs himself . I raised my head in triumph upon the players . After I had returned the money I had taken from it to my father 's purse , I left my winnings with that honest and worthy gentleman , who continued to win . As soon as I found myself possessed of a hundred and sixty francs , I wrapped them up in my handkerchief , so that they could neither move or rattle on the way back ; and I played no more .
30342	30364	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" ' What were you doing at the card - table ? ' said my father as we stepped into the carriage .
30365	30377	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" ' I was looking on , ' I answered , trembling .
30378	30448	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" ' But it would have been nothing out of the common if you had been prompted by self - love to put some money down on the table . In the eyes of men of the world you are quite old enough to assume the right to commit such follies . So I should have pardoned you , Raphael , if you had made use of my purse ..... '
30449	30510	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" I did not answer . When we reached home , I returned the keys and money to my father . As he entered his study , he emptied out his purse on the mantelpiece , counted the money , and turned to me with a kindly look , saying with more or less long and significant pauses between each phrase :
30511	30608	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" ' My boy , you are very nearly twenty now . I am satisfied with you . You ought to have an allowance , if only to teach you how to lay it out , and to gain some acquaintance with everyday business . Henceforward I shall let you have a hundred francs each month . Here is your first quarter 's income for this year , ' he added , fingering a pile of gold , as if to make sure that the amount was correct . ' Do what you please with it . '
30609	30668	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" I confess that I was ready to fling myself at his feet , to tell him that I was a thief , a scoundrel , and , worse than all , a liar ! But a feeling of shame held me back . I went up to him for an embrace , but he gently pushed me away .
30669	30846	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" ' You are a man now , _ my child _ , ' he said . ' What I have just done was a very proper and simple thing , for which there is no need to thank me . If I have any claim to your gratitude , Raphael , ' he went on , in a kind but dignified way , ' it is because I have preserved your youth from the evils that destroy young men in Paris . We will be two friends henceforth . In a year 's time you will be a doctor of law . Not without some hardship and privations you have acquired the sound knowledge and the love of , and application to , work that is indispensable to public men . You must learn to know me , Raphael . I do not want to make either an advocate or a notary of you , but a statesman , who shall be the pride of our poor house .... Good - night , ' he added .
30847	31004	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" From that day my father took me fully into confidence . I was an only son ; and ten years before , I had lost my mother . In time past my father , the head of a historic family remembered even now in Auvergne , had come to Paris to fight against his evil star , dissatisfied at the prospect of tilling the soil , with his useless sword by his side . He was endowed with the shrewdness that gives the men of the south of France a certain ascendency when energy goes with it . Almost unaided , he made a position for himself near the fountain of power . The revolution brought a reverse of fortune , but he had managed to marry an heiress of good family , and , in the time of the Empire , appeared to be on the point of restoring to our house its ancient splendor .
31005	31350	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" The Restoration , while it brought back considerable property to my mother , was my father 's ruin . He had formerly purchased several estates abroad , conferred by the Emperor on his generals ; and now for ten years he struggled with liquidators , diplomatists , and Prussian and Bavarian courts of law , over the disputed possession of these unfortunate endowments . My father plunged me into the intricate labyrinths of law proceedings on which our future depended . We might be compelled to return the rents , as well as the proceeds arising from sales of timber made during the years 1814 to 1817 ; in that case my mother 's property would have barely saved our credit . So it fell out that the day on which my father in a fashion emancipated me , brought me under a most galling yoke . I entered on a conflict like a battlefield ; I must work day and night ; seek interviews with statesmen , surprise their convictions , try to interest them in our affairs , and gain them over , with their wives and servants , and their very dogs ; and all this abominable business had to take the form of pretty speeches and polite attentions . Then I knew the mortifications that had left their blighting traces on my father 's face . For about a year I led outwardly the life of a man of the world , but enormous labors lay beneath the surface of gadding about , and eager efforts to attach myself to influential kinsmen , or to people likely to be useful to us . My relaxations were lawsuits , and memorials still furnished the staple of my conversation . Hitherto my life had been blameless , from the sheer impossibility of indulging the desires of youth ; but now I became my own master , and in dread of involving us both in ruin by some piece of negligence , I did not dare to allow myself any pleasure or expenditure .
31351	31772	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" While we are young , and before the world has rubbed off the delicate bloom from our sentiments , the freshness of our impressions , the noble purity of conscience which will never allow us to palter with evil , the sense of duty is very strong within us , the voice of honor clamors within us , and we are open and straightforward . At that time I was all these things . I wished to justify my father 's confidence in me . But lately I would have stolen a paltry sum from him , with secret delight ; but now that I shared the burden of his affairs , of his name and of his house , I would secretly have given up my fortune and my hopes for him , as I was sacrificing my pleasures , and even have been glad of the sacrifice ! So when M. de Villele exhumed , for our special benefit , an imperial decree concerning forfeitures , and had ruined us , I authorized the sale of my property , only retaining an island in the middle of the Loire where my mother was buried . Perhaps arguments and evasions , philosophical , philanthropic , and political considerations would not fail me now , to hinder the perpetration of what my solicitor termed a ' folly ' ; but at one - and - twenty , I repeat , we are all aglow with generosity and affection . The tears that stood in my father 's eyes were to me the most splendid of fortunes , and the thought of those tears has often soothed my sorrow . Ten months after he had paid his creditors , my father died of grief ; I was his idol , and he had ruined me ! The thought killed him . Towards the end of the autumn of 1826 , at the age of twenty - two , I was the sole mourner at his graveside -- the grave of my father and my earliest friend . Not many young men have found themselves alone with their thoughts as they followed a hearse , or have seen themselves lost in crowded Paris , and without money or prospects . Orphans rescued by public charity have at any rate the future of the battlefield before them , and find a shelter in some institution and a father in the government or in the _ procureur du roi _ . I had nothing .
31773	31848	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" Three months later , an agent made over to me eleven hundred and twelve francs , the net proceeds of the winding up of my father 's affairs . Our creditors had driven us to sell our furniture . From my childhood I had been used to set a high value on the articles of luxury about us , and I could not help showing my astonishment at the sight of this meagre balance .
31849	31991	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" ' Oh , rococo , all of it ! ' said the auctioneer . A terrible word that fell like a blight on the sacred memories of my childhood , and dispelled my earliest illusions , the dearest of all . My entire fortune was comprised in this ' account rendered , ' my future lay in a linen bag with eleven hundred and twelve francs in it , human society stood before me in the person of an auctioneer 's clerk , who kept his hat on while he spoke . Jonathan , an old servant who was much attached to me , and whom my mother had formerly pensioned with an annuity of four hundred francs , spoke to me as I was leaving the house that I had so often gaily left for a drive in my childhood .
31992	32001	28493	28493	Raphael	360	" ' Be very economical , Monsieur Raphael ! '
32002	32008	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" The good fellow was crying .
32009	32042	32044	32044	Raphael	360	" Such were the events , dear Emile , that ruled my destinies , moulded my character , and set me , while still young , in an utterly false social position , "
32049	32288	32044	32044	Raphael	360	" Family ties , weak ones , it is true , bound me to a few wealthy houses , but my own pride would have kept me aloof from them if contempt and indifference had not shut their doors on me in the first place . I was related to people who were very influential , and who lavished their patronage on strangers ; but I found neither relations nor patrons in them . Continually circumscribed in my affections , they recoiled upon me . Unreserved and simple by nature , I must have appeared frigid and sophisticated . My father 's discipline had destroyed all confidence in myself . I was shy and awkward ; I could not believe that my opinion carried any weight whatever ; I took no pleasure in myself ; I thought myself ugly , and was ashamed to meet my own eyes . In spite of the inward voice that must be the stay of a man with anything in him , in all his struggles , the voice that cries , ' Courage ! Go forward ! ' in spite of sudden revelations of my own strength in my solitude ; in spite of the hopes that thrilled me as I compared new works , that the public admired so much , with the schemes that hovered in my brain,--in spite of all this , I had a childish mistrust of myself .
32289	32351	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" An overweening ambition preyed upon me ; I believed that I was meant for great things , and yet I felt myself to be nothing . I had need of other men , and I was friendless . I found I must make my way in the world , where I was quite alone , and bashful , rather than afraid .
32352	32563	32044	32044	Raphael	360	" All through the year in which , by my father 's wish , I threw myself into the whirlpool of fashionable society , I came away with an inexperienced heart , and fresh in mind . Like every grown child , I sighed in secret for a love affair . I met , among young men of my own age , a set of swaggerers who held their heads high , and talked about trifles as they seated themselves without a tremor beside women who inspired awe in me . They chattered nonsense , sucked the heads of their canes , gave themselves affected airs , appropriated the fairest women , and laid , or pretended that they had laid their heads on every pillow . Pleasure , seemingly , was at their beck and call ; they looked on the most virtuous and prudish as an easy prey , ready to surrender at a word , at the slightest impudent gesture or insolent look . I declare , on my soul and conscience , that the attainment of power , or of a great name in literature , seemed to me an easier victory than a success with some young , witty , and gracious lady of high degree .
32564	32989	28624	28624	Raphael	360	" So I found the tumult of my heart , my feelings , and my creeds all at variance with the axioms of society . I had plenty of audacity in my character , but none in my manner . Later , I found out that women did not like to be implored . I have from afar adored many a one to whom I devoted a soul proof against all tests , a heart to break , energy that shrank from no sacrifice and from no torture ; _ they _ accepted fools whom I would not have engaged as hall porters . How often , mute and motionless , have I not admired the lady of my dreams , swaying in the dance ; given up my life in thought to one eternal caress , expressed all my hopes in a look , and laid before her , in my rapture , a young man 's love , which should outstrip all fables . At some moments I was ready to barter my whole life for one single night . Well , as I could never find a listener for my impassioned proposals , eyes to rest my own upon , a heart made for my heart , I lived on in all the sufferings of impotent force that consumes itself ; lacking either opportunity or courage or experience . I despaired , maybe , of making myself understood , or I feared to be understood but too well ; and yet the storm within me was ready to burst at every chance courteous look . In spite of my readiness to take the semblance of interest in look or word for a tenderer solicitude , I dared neither to speak nor to be silent seasonably . My words grew insignificant , and my silence stupid , by sheer stress of emotion . I was too ingenuous , no doubt , for that artificial life , led by candle - light , where every thought is expressed in conventional phrases , or by words that fashion dictates ; and not only so , I had not learned how to employ speech that says nothing , and silence that says a great deal . In short , I concealed the fires that consumed me , and with such a soul as women wish to find , with all the elevation of soul that they long for , and a mettle that fools plume themselves upon , all women have been cruelly treacherous to me .
32990	33147	32044	32044	Raphael	360	" So in my simplicity I admired the heroes of this set when they bragged about their conquests , and never suspected them of lying . No doubt it was a mistake to wish for a love that springs for a word 's sake ; to expect to find in the heart of a vain , frivolous woman , greedy for luxury and intoxicated with vanity , the great sea of passion that surged tempestuously in my own breast . Oh ! to feel that you were born to love , to make some woman 's happiness , and yet to find not one , not even a noble and courageous Marceline , not so much as an old Marquise ! Oh ! to carry a treasure in your wallet , and not find even some child , or inquisitive young girl , to admire it ! In my despair I often wished to kill myself . "
33148	33155	33157	33157	Emile	248	" Finely tragical to - night ! "
33159	33168	33169	33169	Raphael	360	" Let me pass sentence on my life , "
33172	33284	33169	33169	Raphael	360	" If your friendship is not strong enough to bear with my elegy , if you can not put up with half an hour 's tedium for my sake , go to sleep ! But , then , never ask again for the reason of suicide that hangs over me , that comes nearer and calls to me , that I bow myself before . If you are to judge a man , you must know his secret thoughts , sorrows , and feelings ; to know merely the outward events of a man 's life would only serve to make a chronological table -- a fool 's notion of history . "
33319	33322	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" Now , "
33327	33532	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" all these things that befell me appear in a new light . The sequence of events that I once thought so unfortunate created the splendid powers of which , later , I became so proud . If I may believe you , I possess the power of readily expressing my thoughts , and I could take a forward place in the great field of knowledge ; and is not this the result of scientific curiosity , of excessive application , and a love of reading which possessed me from the age of seven till my entry on life ? The very neglect in which I was left , and the consequent habits of self - repression and self - concentration ; did not these things teach me how to consider and reflect ? Nothing in me was squandered in obedience to the exactions of the world , which humble the proudest soul and reduce it to a mere husk ; and was it not this very fact that refined the emotional part of my nature till it became the perfected instrument of a loftier purpose than passionate desires ? I remember watching the women who mistook me with all the insight of contemned love .
33533	33812	33302	33302	he	248	" I can see now that my natural sincerity must have been displeasing to them ; women , perhaps , even require a little hypocrisy . And I , who in the same hour 's space am alternately a man and a child , frivolous and thoughtful , free from bias and brimful of superstition , and oftentimes myself as much a woman as any of them ; how should they do otherwise than take my simplicity for cynicism , my innocent candor for impudence ? They found my knowledge tiresome ; my feminine languor , weakness . I was held to be listless and incapable of love or of steady purpose ; a too active imagination , that curse of poets , was no doubt the cause . My silence was idiotic ; and as I daresay I alarmed them by my efforts to please , women one and all have condemned me . With tears and mortification , I bowed before the decision of the world ; but my distress was not barren . I determined to revenge myself on society ; I would dominate the feminine intellect , and so have the feminine soul at my mercy ; all eyes should be fixed upon me , when the servant at the door announced my name . I had determined from my childhood that I would be a great man ; I said with Andre Chenier , as I struck my forehead , ' There is something underneath that ! ' I felt , I believed , the thought within me that I must express , the system I must establish , the knowledge I must interpret .
33813	34145	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" Let me pour out my follies , dear Emile ; to - day I am barely twenty - six years old , certain of dying unrecognized , and I have never been the lover of the woman I dreamed of possessing . Have we not all of us , more or less , believed in the reality of a thing because we wished it ? I would never have a young man for my friend who did not place himself in dreams upon a pedestal , weave crowns for his head , and have complaisant mistresses . I myself would often be a general , nay , emperor ; I have been a Byron , and then a nobody . After this sport on these pinnacles of human achievement , I became aware that all the difficulties and steeps of life were yet to face . My exuberant self - esteem came to my aid ; I had that intense belief in my destiny , which perhaps amounts to genius in those who will not permit themselves to be distracted by contact with the world , as sheep that leave their wool on the briars of every thicket they pass by . I meant to cover myself with glory , and to work in silence for the mistress I hoped to have one day . Women for me were resumed into a single type , and this woman I looked to meet in the first that met my eyes ; but in each and all I saw a queen , and as queens must make the first advances to their lovers , they must draw near to me -- to me , so sickly , shy , and poor . For her , who should take pity on me , my heart held in store such gratitude over and beyond love , that I had worshiped her her whole life long . Later , my observations have taught me bitter truths .
34146	34763	33302	33302	he	248	" In this way , dear Emile , I ran the risk of remaining companionless for good . The incomprehensible bent of women 's minds appears to lead them to see nothing but the weak points in a clever man , and the strong points of a fool . They feel the liveliest sympathy with the fool 's good qualities , which perpetually flatter their own defects ; while they find the man of talent hardly agreeable enough to compensate for his shortcomings . All capacity is a sort of intermittent fever , and no woman is anxious to share in its discomforts only ; they look to find in their lovers the wherewithal to gratify their own vanity . It is themselves that they love in us ! But the artist , poor and proud , along with his endowment of creative power , is furnished with an aggressive egotism ! Everything about him is involved in I know not what whirlpool of his ideas , and even his mistress must gyrate along with them . How is a woman , spoilt with praise , to believe in the love of a man like that ? Will she go to seek him out ? That sort of lover has not the leisure to sit beside a sofa and give himself up to the sentimental simperings that women are so fond of , and on which the false and unfeeling pride themselves . He can not spare the time from his work , and how can he afford to humble himself and go a - masquerading ! I was ready to give my life once and for all , but I could not degrade it in detail . Besides , there is something indescribably paltry in a stockbroker 's tactics , who runs on errands for some insipid affected woman ; all this disgusts an artist . Love in the abstract is not enough for a great man in poverty ; he has need of its utmost devotion . The frivolous creatures who spend their lives in trying on cashmeres , or make themselves into clothes - pegs to hang the fashions from , exact the devotion which is not theirs to give ; for them , love means the pleasure of ruling and not of obeying . She who is really a wife , one in heart , flesh , and bone , must follow wherever he leads , in whom her life , her strength , her pride , and happiness are centered . Ambitious men need those Oriental women whose whole thought is given to the study of their requirements ; for unhappiness means for them the incompatibility of their means with their desires . But I , who took myself for a man of genius , must needs feel attracted by these very she - coxcombs . So , as I cherished ideas so different from those generally received ; as I wished to scale the heavens without a ladder , was possessed of wealth that could not circulate , and of knowledge so wide and so imperfectly arranged and digested that it overtaxed my memory ; as I had neither relations nor friends in the midst of this lonely and ghastly desert , a desert of paving stones , full of animation , life , and thought , wherein every one is worse than inimical , indifferent to wit ; I made a very natural if foolish resolve , which required such unknown impossibilities , that my spirits rose . It was as if I had laid a wager with myself , for I was at once the player and the cards .
34764	34940	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" This was my plan . The eleven hundred francs must keep life in me for three years -- the time I allowed myself in which to bring to light a work which should draw attention to me , and make me either a name or a fortune . I exulted at the thought of living on bread and milk , like a hermit in the Thebaid , while I plunged into the world of books and ideas , and so reached a lofty sphere beyond the tumult of Paris , a sphere of silent labor where I would entomb myself like a chrysalis to await a brilliant and splendid new birth . I imperiled my life in order to live . By reducing my requirements to real needs and the barest necessaries , I found that three hundred and sixty - five francs sufficed for a year of penury ; and , in fact , I managed to exist on that slender sum , so long as I submitted to my own claustral discipline . "
34941	34944	34946	34946	Emile	248	" Impossible ! "
34948	34959	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I lived for nearly three years in that way , "
34969	35216	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Let us reckon it out . Three sous for bread , two for milk , and three for cold meat , kept me from dying of hunger , and my mind in a state of peculiar lucidity . I have observed , as you know , the wonderful effects produced by diet upon the imagination . My lodgings cost me three sous daily ; I burnt three sous more in oil at night ; I did my own housework , and wore flannel shirts so as to reduce the laundress ' bill to two sous per day . The money I spent yearly in coal , if divided up , never cost more than two sous for each day . I had three years ' supply of clothing , and I only dressed when going out to some library or public lecture . These expenses , all told , only amounted to eighteen sous , so two were left over for emergencies . I can not recollect , during that long period of toil , either crossing the Pont des Arts , or paying for water ; I went out to fetch it every morning from the fountain in the Place Saint Michel , at the corner of the Rue de Gres . Oh , I wore my poverty proudly . A man urged on towards a fair future walks through life like an innocent person to his death ; he feels no shame about it .
35217	35403	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" I would not think of illness . Like Aquilina , I faced the hospital without terror . I had not a moment 's doubt of my health , and besides , the poor can only take to their beds to die . I cut my own hair till the day when an angel of love and kindness ... But I do not want to anticipate the state of things that I shall reach later . You must simply know that I lived with one grand thought for a mistress , a dream , an illusion which deceives us all more or less at first . To - day I laugh at myself , at that self , holy perhaps and heroic , which is now no more . I have since had a closer view of society and the world , of our manners and customs , and seen the dangers of my innocent credulity and the superfluous nature of my fervent toil . Stores of that sort are quite useless to aspirants for fame . Light should be the baggage of seekers after fortune !
35404	35651	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Ambitious men spend their youth in rendering themselves worthy of patronage ; it is their great mistake . While the foolish creatures are laying in stores of knowledge and energy , so that they shall not sink under the weight of responsible posts that recede from them , schemers come and go who are wealthy in words and destitute in ideas , astonish the ignorant , and creep into the confidence of those who have a little knowledge . While the first kind study , the second march ahead ; the one sort is modest , and the other impudent ; the man of genius is silent about his own merits , but these schemers make a flourish of theirs , and they are bound to get on . It is so strongly to the interest of men in office to believe in ready - made capacity , and in brazen - faced merit , that it is downright childish of the learned to expect material rewards . I do not seek to paraphrase the commonplace moral , the song of songs that obscure genius is for ever singing ; I want to come , in a logical manner , by the reason of the frequent successes of mediocrity . Alas ! study shows us such a mother 's kindness that it would be a sin perhaps to ask any other reward of her than the pure and delightful pleasures with which she sustains her children .
35652	35863	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" Often I remember soaking my bread in milk , as I sat by the window to take the fresh air ; while my eyes wandered over a view of roofs -- brown , gray , or red , slated or tiled , and covered with yellow or green mosses . At first the prospect may have seemed monotonous , but I very soon found peculiar beauties in it . Sometimes at night , streams of light through half - closed shutters would light up and color the dark abysses of this strange landscape . Sometimes the feeble lights of the street lamps sent up yellow gleams through the fog , and in each street dimly outlined the undulations of a crowd of roofs , like billows in a motionless sea . Very occasionally , too , a face appeared in this gloomy waste ; above the flowers in some skyey garden I caught a glimpse of an old woman 's crooked angular profile as she watered her nasturtiums ; or , in a crazy attic window , a young girl , fancying herself quite alone as she dressed herself -- a view of nothing more than a fair forehead and long tresses held above her by a pretty white arm .
35864	36009	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I liked to see the short - lived plant - life in the gutters -- poor weeds that a storm soon washed away . I studied the mosses , with their colors revived by showers , or transformed by the sun into a brown velvet that fitfully caught the light . Such things as these formed my recreations -- the passing poetic moods of daylight , the melancholy mists , sudden gleams of sunlight , the silence and the magic of night , the mysteries of dawn , the smoke wreaths from each chimney ; every chance event , in fact , in my curious world became familiar to me . I came to love this prison of my own choosing . This level Parisian prairie of roofs , beneath which lay populous abysses , suited my humor , and harmonized with my thoughts .
36010	36249	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" Sudden descents into the world from the divine height of scientific meditation are very exhausting ; and , besides , I had apprehended perfectly the bare life of the cloister . When I made up my mind to carry out this new plan of life , I looked for quarters in the most out - of - the - way parts of Paris . One evening , as I returned home to the Rue des Cordiers from the Place de l'Estrapade , I saw a girl of fourteen playing with a battledore at the corner of the Rue de Cluny , her winsome ways and laughter amused the neighbors . September was not yet over ; it was warm and fine , so that women sat chatting before their doors as if it were a fete - day in some country town . At first I watched the charming expression of the girl 's face and her graceful attitudes , her pose fit for a painter . It was a pretty sight . I looked about me , seeking to understand this blithe simplicity in the midst of Paris , and saw that the street was a blind alley and but little frequented . I remembered that Jean Jacques had once lived here , and looked up the Hotel Saint - Quentin . Its dilapidated condition awakened hopes of a cheap lodging , and I determined to enter .
36250	36426	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I found myself in a room with a low ceiling ; the candles , in classic - looking copper candle - sticks , were set in a row under each key . The predominating cleanliness of the room made a striking contrast to the usual state of such places . This one was as neat as a bit of genre ; there was a charming trimness about the blue coverlet , the cooking pots and furniture . The mistress of the house rose and came to me . She seemed to be about forty years of age ; sorrows had left their traces on her features , and weeping had dimmed her eyes . I deferentially mentioned the amount I could pay ; it seemed to cause her no surprise ; she sought out a key from the row , went up to the attics with me , and showed me a room that looked out on the neighboring roofs and courts ; long poles with linen drying on them hung out of the window .
36427	36567	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" Nothing could be uglier than this garret , awaiting its scholar , with its dingy yellow walls and odor of poverty . The roofing fell in a steep slope , and the sky was visible through chinks in the tiles . There was room for a bed , a table , and a few chairs , and beneath the highest point of the roof my piano could stand . Not being rich enough to furnish this cage ( that might have been one of the _ Piombi _ of Venice ) , the poor woman had never been able to let it ; and as I had saved from the recent sale the furniture that was in a fashion peculiarly mine , I very soon came to terms with my landlady , and moved in on the following day .
36568	36763	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" For three years I lived in this airy sepulchre , and worked unflaggingly day and night ; and so great was the pleasure that study seemed to me the fairest theme and the happiest solution of life . The tranquillity and peace that a scholar needs is something as sweet and exhilarating as love . Unspeakable joys are showered on us by the exertion of our mental faculties ; the quest of ideas , and the tranquil contemplation of knowledge ; delights indescribable , because purely intellectual and impalpable to our senses . So we are obliged to use material terms to express the mysteries of the soul . The pleasure of striking out in some lonely lake of clear water , with forests , rocks , and flowers around , and the soft stirring of the warm breeze,--all this would give , to those who knew them not , a very faint idea of the exultation with which my soul bathed itself in the beams of an unknown light , hearkened to the awful and uncertain voice of inspiration , as vision upon vision poured from some unknown source through my throbbing brain .
36764	37070	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" No earthly pleasure can compare with the divine delight of watching the dawn of an idea in the space of abstractions as it rises like the morning sun ; an idea that , better still , attains gradually like a child to puberty and man 's estate . Study lends a kind of enchantment to all our surroundings . The wretched desk covered with brown leather at which I wrote , my piano , bed , and armchair , the odd wall - paper and furniture seemed to have for me a kind of life in them , and to be humble friends of mine and mute partakers of my destiny . How often have I confided my soul to them in a glance ! A warped bit of beading often met my eyes , and suggested new developments,--a striking proof of my system , or a felicitous word by which to render my all but inexpressible thought . By sheer contemplation of the things about me I discerned an expression and a character in each . If the setting sun happened to steal in through my narrow window , they would take new colors , fade or shine , grow dull or gay , and always amaze me with some new effect . These trifling incidents of a solitary life , which escape those preoccupied with outward affairs , make the solace of prisoners . And what was I but the captive of an idea , imprisoned in my system , but sustained also by the prospect of a brilliant future ? At each obstacle that I overcame , I seemed to kiss the soft hands of a woman with a fair face , a wealthy , well - dressed woman , who should some day say softly , while she caressed my hair :
37071	37081	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Poor Angel , how thou hast suffered ! '
37082	37255	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" I had undertaken two great works -- one a comedy that in a very short time must bring me wealth and fame , and an entry into those circles whither I wished to return , to exercise the royal privileges of a man of genius . You all saw nothing in that masterpiece but the blunder of a young man fresh from college , a babyish fiasco . Your jokes clipped the wings of a throng of illusions , which have never stirred since within me . You , dear Emile , alone brought soothing to the deep wounds that others had made in my heart . You alone will admire my ' Theory of the Will . ' I devoted most of my time to that long work , for which I studied Oriental languages , physiology and anatomy . If I do not deceive myself , my labors will complete the task begun by Mesmer , Lavater , Gall , and Bichat , and open up new paths in science .
37256	37491	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" There ends that fair life of mine , the daily sacrifice , the unrecognized silkworm 's toil , that is , perhaps , its own sole recompense . Since attaining years of discretion , until the day when I finished my ' Theory , ' I observed , learned , wrote , and read unintermittingly ; my life was one long imposition , as schoolboys say . Though by nature effeminately attached to Oriental indolence , sensual in tastes , and a wooer of dreams , I worked incessantly , and refused to taste any of the enjoyments of Parisian life . Though a glutton , I became abstemious ; and loving exercise and sea voyages as I did , and haunted by the wish to visit many countries , still child enough to play at ducks and drakes with pebbles over a pond , I led a sedentary life with a pen in my fingers . I liked talking , but I went to sit and mutely listen to professors who gave public lectures at the _ Bibliotheque _ or the Museum . I slept upon my solitary pallet like a Benedictine brother , though woman was my one chimera , a chimera that fled from me as I wooed it ! In short , my life has been a cruel contradiction , a perpetual cheat . After that , judge a man !
37492	37698	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" Sometimes my natural propensities broke out like a fire long smothered . I was debarred from the women whose society I desired , stripped of everything and lodged in an artist 's garret , and by a sort of mirage or calenture I was surrounded by captivating mistresses . I drove through the streets of Paris , lolling on the soft cushions of a fine equipage . I plunged into dissipation , into corroding vice , I desired and possessed everything , for fasting had made me light - headed like the tempted Saint Anthony . Slumber , happily , would put an end at last to these devastating trances ; and on the morrow science would beckon me , smiling , and I was faithful to her . I imagine that women reputed virtuous , must often fall a prey to these insane tempests of desire and passion , which rise in us in spite of ourselves . Such dreams have a charm of their own ; they are something akin to evening gossip round the winter fire , when one sets out for some voyage in China . But what becomes of virtue during these delicious excursions , when fancy overleaps all difficulties ?
37699	37878	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" During the first ten months of seclusion I led the life of poverty and solitude that I have described to you ; I used to steal out unobserved every morning to buy my own provisions for the day ; I tidied my room ; I was at once master and servant , and played the Diogenes with incredible spirit . But afterwards , while my hostess and her daughter watched my ways and behavior , scrutinized my appearance and divined my poverty , there could not but be some bonds between us ; perhaps because they were themselves so very poor . Pauline , the charming child , whose latent and unconscious grace had , in a manner , brought me there , did me many services that I could not well refuse . All women fallen on evil days are sisters ; they speak a common language ; they have the same generosity -- the generosity that possesses nothing , and so is lavish of its affection , of its time , and of its very self .
37879	37936	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" Imperceptibly Pauline took me under her protection , and would do things for me . No kind of objection was made by her mother , whom I even surprised mending my linen ; she blushed for the charitable occupation . In spite of myself , they took charge of me , and I accepted their services .
37937	38064	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" In order to understand the peculiar condition of my mind , my preoccupation with work must be remembered , the tyranny of ideas , and the instinctive repugnance that a man who leads an intellectual life must ever feel for the material details of existence . Could I well repulse the delicate attentions of Pauline , who would noiselessly bring me my frugal repast , when she noticed that I had taken nothing for seven or eight hours ? She had the tact of a woman and the inventiveness of a child ; she would smile as she made sign to me that I must not see her . Ariel glided under my roof in the form of a sylph who foresaw every want of mine .
38065	38188	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" One evening Pauline told me her story with touching simplicity . Her father had been a major in the horse grenadiers of the Imperial Guard . He had been taken prisoner by the Cossacks , at the passage of Beresina ; and when Napoleon later on proposed an exchange , the Russian authorities made search for him in Siberia in vain ; he had escaped with a view of reaching India , and since then Mme . Gaudin , my landlady , could hear no news of her husband . Then came the disasters of 1814 and 1815 ; and , left alone and without resource , she had decided to let furnished lodgings in order to keep herself and her daughter .
38189	38726	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She always hoped to see her husband again . Her greatest trouble was about her daughter 's education ; the Princess Borghese was her Pauline 's godmother ; and Pauline must not be unworthy of the fair future promised by her imperial protectress . When Mme . Gaudin confided to me this heavy trouble that preyed upon her , she said , with sharp pain in her voice , ' I would give up the property and the scrap of paper that makes Gaudin a baron of the empire , and all our rights to the endowment of Wistchnau , if only Pauline could be brought up at Saint - Denis ? ' Her words struck me ; now I could show my gratitude for the kindnesses expended on me by the two women ; all at once the idea of offering to finish Pauline 's education occurred to me ; and the offer was made and accepted in the most perfect simplicity . In this way I came to have some hours of recreation . Pauline had natural aptitude ; she learned so quickly , that she soon surpassed me at the piano . As she became accustomed to think aloud in my presence , she unfolded all the sweet refinements of a heart that was opening itself out to life , as some flower - cup opens slowly to the sun . She listened to me , pleased and thoughtful , letting her dark velvet eyes rest upon me with a half smile in them ; she repeated her lessons in soft and gentle tones , and showed childish glee when I was satisfied with her . Her mother grew more and more anxious every day to shield the young girl from every danger ( for all the beauty promised in early life was developing in the crescent moon ) , and was glad to see her spend whole days indoors in study . My piano was the only one she could use , and while I was out she practised on it . When I came home , Pauline would be in my room , in her shabby dress , but her slightest movement revealed her slender figure in its attractive grace , in spite of the coarse materials that she wore . As with the heroine of the fable of ' _ Peau - d'Ane _ , ' a dainty foot peeped out of the clumsy shoes . But all her wealth of girlish beauty was as lost upon me . I had laid commands upon myself to see a sister only in Pauline . I dreaded lest I should betray her mother 's faith in me . I admired the lovely girl as if she had been a picture , or as the portrait of a dead mistress ; she was at once my child and my statue . For me , another Pygmalion , the maiden with the hues of life and the living voice was to become a form of inanimate marble . I was very strict with her , but the more I made her feel my pedagogue 's severity , the more gentle and submissive she grew .
38727	38953	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" If a generous feeling strengthened me in my reserve and self - restraint , prudent considerations were not lacking beside . Integrity of purpose can not , I think , fail to accompany integrity in money matters . To my mind , to become insolvent or to betray a woman is the same sort of thing . If you love a young girl , or allow yourself to be beloved by her , a contract is implied , and its conditions should be thoroughly understood . We are free to break with the woman who sells herself , but not with the young girl who has given herself to us and does not know the extent of her sacrifice . I must have married Pauline , and that would have been madness . Would it not have given over that sweet girlish heart to terrible misfortunes ? My poverty made its selfish voice heard , and set an iron barrier between that gentle nature and mine . Besides , I am ashamed to say , that I can not imagine love in the midst of poverty . Perhaps this is a vitiation due to that malady of mankind called civilization ; but a woman in squalid poverty would exert no fascination over me , were she attractive as Homer 's Galatea , the fair Helen .
38954	39199	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Ah , _ vive l'amour _ ! But let it be in silk and cashmere , surrounded with the luxury which so marvelously embellishes it ; for is it not perhaps itself a luxury ? I enjoy making havoc with an elaborate erection of scented hair ; I like to crush flowers , to disarrange and crease a smart toilette at will . A bizarre attraction lies for me in burning eyes that blaze through a lace veil , like flame through cannon smoke . My way of love would be to mount by a silken ladder , in the silence of a winter night . And what bliss to reach , all powdered with snow , a perfumed room , with hangings of painted silk , to find a woman there , who likewise shakes away the snow from her ; for what other name can be found for the white muslin wrappings that vaguely define her , like some angel form issuing from a cloud ! And then I wish for furtive joys , for the security of audacity . I want to see once more that woman of mystery , but let it be in the throng , dazzling , unapproachable , adored on all sides , dressed in laces and ablaze with diamonds , laying her commands upon every one ; so exalted above us , that she inspires awe , and none dares to pay his homage to her .
39200	39318	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" She gives me a stolen glance , amid her court , a look that exposes the unreality of all this ; that resigns for me the world and all men in it ! Truly I have scorned myself for a passion for a few yards of lace , velvet , and fine lawn , and the hairdresser 's feats of skill ; a love of wax - lights , a carriage and a title , a heraldic coronet painted on window panes , or engraved by a jeweler ; in short , a liking for all that is adventitious and least woman in woman . I have scorned and reasoned with myself , but all in vain .
39319	39440	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" A woman of rank with her subtle smile , her high - born air , and self - esteem captivates me . The barriers she erects between herself and the world awaken my vanity , a good half of love . There would be more relish for me in bliss that all others envied . If my mistress does nothing that other women do , and neither lives nor conducts herself like them , wears a cloak that they can not attain , breathes a perfume of her own , then she seems to rise far above me . The further she rises from earth , even in the earthlier aspects of love , the fairer she becomes for me .
39441	39561	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" Luckily for me we have had no queen in France these twenty years , for I should have fallen in love with her . A woman must be wealthy to acquire the manners of a princess . What place had Pauline among these far - fetched imaginings ? Could she bring me the love that is death , that brings every faculty into play , the nights that are paid for by life ? We hardly die , I think , for an insignificant girl who gives herself to us ; and I could never extinguish these feelings and poet 's dreams within me . I was born for an inaccessible love , and fortune has overtopped my desire .
39562	39723	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" How often have I set satin shoes on Pauline 's tiny feet , confined her form , slender as a young poplar , in a robe of gauze , and thrown a loose scarf about her as I saw her tread the carpets in her mansion and led her out to her splendid carriage ! In such guise I should have adored her . I endowed her with all the pride she lacked , stripped her of her virtues , her natural simple charm , and frank smile , in order to plunge her heart in our Styx of depravity that makes invulnerable , load her with our crimes , make of her the fantastical doll of our drawing - rooms , the frail being who lies about in the morning and comes to life again at night with the dawn of tapers . Pauline was fresh - hearted and affectionate -- I would have had her cold and formal .
39724	39928	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" In the last days of my frantic folly , memory brought Pauline before me , as it brings the scenes of our childhood , and made me pause to muse over past delicious moments that softened my heart . I sometimes saw her , the adorable girl who sat quietly sewing at my table , wrapped in her meditations ; the faint light from my window fell upon her and was reflected back in silvery rays from her thick black hair ; sometimes I heard her young laughter , or the rich tones of her voice singing some canzonet that she composed without effort . And often my Pauline seemed to grow greater , as music flowed from her , and her face bore a striking resemblance to the noble one that Carlo Dolci chose for the type of Italy . My cruel memory brought her back athwart the dissipations of my existence , like a remorse , or a symbol of purity . But let us leave the poor child to her own fate . Whatever her troubles may have been , at any rate I protected her from a menacing tempest -- I did not drag her down into my hell .
39929	40180	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Until last winter I led the uneventful studious life of which I have given you some faint picture . In the earliest days of December 1829 , I came across Rastignac , who , in spite of the shabby condition of my wardrobe , linked his arm in mine , and inquired into my affairs with a quite brotherly interest . Caught by his engaging manner , I gave him a brief account of my life and hopes ; he began to laugh , and treated me as a mixture of a man of genius and a fool . His Gascon accent and knowledge of the world , the easy life his clever management procured for him , all produced an irresistible effect upon me . I should die an unrecognized failure in a hospital , Rastignac said , and be buried in a pauper 's grave . He talked of charlatanism . Every man of genius was a charlatan , he plainly showed me in that pleasant way of his that makes him so fascinating . He insisted that I must be out of my senses , and would be my own death , if I lived on alone in the Rue des Cordiers . According to him , I ought to go into society , to accustom people to the sound of my name , and to rid myself of the simple title of ' monsieur ' which sits but ill on a great man in his lifetime .
40181	40210	33324	33325	the speaker	1011	" ' Those who know no better , ' he cried , ' call this sort of business _ scheming _ , and moral people condemn it for a "
40214	40739	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" We need not stop to look at what people think , but see the results . You work , you say ? Very good , but nothing will ever come of that . Now , I am ready for anything and fit for nothing . As lazy as a lobster ? Very likely , but I succeed everywhere . I go out into society , I push myself forward , the others make way before me ; I brag and am believed ; I incur debts which somebody else pays ! Dissipation , dear boy , is a methodical policy . The life of a man who deliberately runs through his fortune often becomes a business speculation ; his friends , his pleasures , patrons , and acquaintances are his capital . Suppose a merchant runs a risk of a million , for twenty years he can neither sleep , eat , nor amuse himself , he is brooding over his million , it makes him run about all over Europe ; he worries himself , goes to the devil in every way that man has invented . Then comes a liquidation , such as I have seen myself , which very often leaves him penniless and without a reputation or a friend . The spendthrift , on the other hand , takes life as a serious game and sees his horses run . He loses his capital , perhaps , but he stands a chance of being nominated Receiver - General , of making a wealthy marriage , or of an appointment of attache to a minister or ambassador ; and he has his friends left and his name , and he never wants money . He knows the standing of everybody , and uses every one for his own benefit . Is this logical , or am I a madman after all ? Have n't you there all the moral of the comedy that goes on every day in this world ? ... Your work is completed ' he went on after a pause ; ' you are immensely clever ! Well , you have only arrived at my starting - point . Now , you had better look after its success yourself ; it is the surest way . You will make allies in every clique , and secure applause beforehand . I mean to go halves in your glory myself ; I shall be the jeweler who set the diamonds in your crown . Come here to - morrow evening , by way of a beginning . I will introduce you to a house where all Paris goes , all OUR Paris , that is -- the Paris of exquisites , millionaires , celebrities , all the folk who talk gold like Chrysostom . When they have taken up a book , that book becomes the fashion ; and if it is something really good for once , they will have declared it to be a work of genius without knowing it . If you have any sense , my dear fellow , you will ensure the success of your "
40742	40773	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" by a better understanding of the theory of success . To - morrow evening you shall go to see that queen of the moment -- the beautiful Countess Foedora .... '
40774	40783	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I have never heard of her .... '
40784	40901	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You Hottentot ! ' laughed Rastignac ; ' you do not know Foedora ? A great match with an income of nearly eighty thousand livres , who has taken a fancy to nobody , or else no one has taken a fancy to her . A sort of feminine enigma , a half Russian Parisienne , or a half Parisian Russian . All the romantic productions that never get published are brought out at her house ; she is the handsomest woman in Paris , and the most gracious ! You are not even a Hottentot ; you are something between the Hottentot and the beast .... Good - bye till to - morrow . '
40902	41027	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" He swung round on his heel and made off without waiting for my answer . It never occurred to him that a reasoning being could refuse an introduction to Foedora . How can the fascination of a name be explained ? FOEDORA haunted me like some evil thought , with which you seek to come to terms . A voice said in me , ' You are going to see Foedora ! ' In vain I reasoned with that voice , saying that it lied to me ; all my arguments were defeated by the name ' Foedora . ' Was not the name , and even the woman herself , the symbol of all my desires , and the object of my life ?
41028	41181	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The name called up recollections of the conventional glitter of the world , the upper world of Paris with its brilliant fetes and the tinsel of its vanities . The woman brought before me all the problems of passion on which my mind continually ran . Perhaps it was neither the woman nor the name , but my own propensities , that sprang up within me and tempted me afresh . Here was the Countess Foedora , rich and loveless , proof against the temptations of Paris ; was not this woman the very incarnation of my hopes and visions ? I fashioned her for myself , drew her in fancy , and dreamed of her . I could not sleep that night ; I became her lover ; I overbrimmed a few hours with a whole lifetime -- a lover 's lifetime ; the experience of its prolific delights burned me .
41182	41471	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The next day I could not bear the tortures of delay ; I borrowed a novel , and spent the whole day over it , so that I could not possibly think nor keep account of the time till night . Foedora 's name echoed through me even as I read , but only as a distant sound ; though it could be heard , it was not troublesome . Fortunately , I owned a fairly creditable black coat and a white waistcoat ; of all my fortune there now remained abut thirty francs , which I had distributed about among my clothes and in my drawers , so as to erect between my whims and the spending of a five - franc piece a thorny barrier of search , and an adventurous peregrination round my room . While I as dressing , I dived about for my money in an ocean of papers . This scarcity of specie will give you some idea of the value of that squandered upon gloves and cab - hire ; a month 's bread disappeared at one fell swoop . Alas ! money is always forthcoming for our caprices ; we only grudge the cost of things that are useful or necessary . We recklessly fling gold to an opera - dancer , and haggle with a tradesman whose hungry family must wait for the settlement of our bill . How many men are there that wear a coat that cost a hundred francs , and carry a diamond in the head of their cane , and dine for twenty - five SOUS for all that ! It seems as though we could never pay enough for the pleasures of vanity .
41472	41536	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Rastignac , punctual to his appointment , smiled at the transformation , and joked about it . On the way he gave me benevolent advice as to my conduct with the countess ; he described her as mean , vain , and suspicious ; but though mean , she was ostentatious , her vanity was transparent , and her mistrust good - humored .
41537	41823	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You know I am pledged , ' he said , ' and what I should lose , too , if I tried a change in love . So my observation of Foedora has been quite cool and disinterested , and my remarks must have some truth in them . I was looking to your future when I thought of introducing you to her ; so mind very carefully what I am about to say . She has a terrible memory . She is clever enough to drive a diplomatist wild ; she would know it at once if he spoke the truth . Between ourselves , I fancy that her marriage was not recognized by the Emperor , for the Russian ambassador began to smile when I spoke of her ; he does not receive her either , and only bows very coolly if he meets her in the Bois . For all that , she is in Madame de Serizy 's set , and visits Mesdames de Nucingen and de Restaud . There is no cloud over her here in France ; the Duchesse de Carigliano , the most - strait - laced marechale in the whole Bonapartist coterie , often goes to spend the summer with her at her country house . Plenty of young fops , sons of peers of France , have offered her a title in exchange for her fortune , and she has politely declined them all . Her susceptibilities , maybe , are not to be touched by anything less than a count . Are n't you a marquis ? Go ahead if you fancy her . This is what you may call receiving your instructions . '
41824	41986	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" His raillery made me think that Rastignac wished to joke and excite my curiosity , so that I was in a paroxysm of my extemporized passion by the time that we stopped before a peristyle full of flowers . My heart beat and my color rose as we went up the great carpeted staircase , and I noticed about me all the studied refinements of English comfort ; I was infatuatedly bourgeois ; I forgot my origin and all my personal and family pride . Alas ! I had but just left a garret , after three years of poverty , and I could not just then set the treasures there acquired above such trifles as these . Nor could I rightly estimate the worth of the vast intellectual capital which turns to riches at the moment when opportunity comes within our reach , opportunity that does not overwhelm , because study has prepared us for the struggles of public life .
41987	42236	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I found a woman of about twenty - two years of age ; she was of average height , was dressed in white , and held a feather fire - screen in her hand ; a group of men stood around her . She rose at the sight of Rastignac , and came towards us with a gracious smile and a musically - uttered compliment , prepared no doubt beforehand , for me . Our friend had spoken of me as a rising man , and his clever way of making the most of me had procured me this flattering reception . I was confused by the attention that every one paid to me ; but Rastignac had luckily mentioned my modesty . I was brought in contact with scholars , men of letters , ex - ministers , and peers of France . The conversation , interrupted a while by my coming , was resumed . I took courage , feeling that I had a reputation to maintain , and without abusing my privilege , I spoke when it fell to me to speak , trying to state the questions at issue in words more or less profound , witty or trenchant , and I made a certain sensation . Rastignac was a prophet for the thousandth time in his life . As soon as the gathering was large enough to restore freedom to individuals , he took my arm , and we went round the rooms .
42237	42270	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Do n't look as if you were too much struck by the princess , ' he said , ' or she will guess your object in coming to visit her . '
42271	42504	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The rooms were furnished in excellent taste . Each apartment had a character of its own , as in wealthy English houses ; and the silken hangings , the style of the furniture , and the ornaments , even the most trifling , were all subordinated to the original idea . In a gothic boudoir the doors were concealed by tapestried curtains , and the paneling by hangings ; the clock and the pattern of the carpet were made to harmonize with the gothic surroundings . The ceiling , with its carved cross - beams of brown wood , was full of charm and originality ; the panels were beautifully wrought ; nothing disturbed the general harmony of the scheme of decoration , not even the windows with their rich colored glass . I was surprised by the extensive knowledge of decoration that some artist had brought to bear on a little modern room , it was so pleasant and fresh , and not heavy , but subdued with its dead gold hues . It had all the vague sentiment of a German ballad ; it was a retreat fit for some romance of 1827 , perfumed by the exotic flowers set in their stands . Another apartment in the suite was a gilded reproduction of the Louis Quatorze period , with modern paintings on the walls in odd but pleasant contrast .
42505	42587	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You would not be so badly lodged , ' was Rastignac 's slightly sarcastic comment . ' It is captivating , is n't it ? ' he added , smiling as he sat down . Then suddenly he rose , and led me by the hand into a bedroom , where the softened light fell upon the bed under its canopy of muslin and white watered silk -- a couch for a young fairy betrothed to one of the genii .
42588	42656	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Is n't it wantonly bad taste , insolent and unbounded coquetry , ' he said , lowering his voice , ' that allows us to see this throne of love ? She gives herself to no one , and anybody may leave his card here . If I were not committed , I should like to see her at my feet all tears and submission . '
42657	42667	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Are you so certain of her virtue ? '
42668	42701	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' The boldest and even the cleverest adventurers among us , acknowledge themselves defeated , and continue to be her lovers and devoted friends . Is n't that woman a puzzle ? '
42702	43003	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" His words seemed to intoxicate me ; I had jealous fears already of the past . I leapt for joy , and hurried back to the countess , whom I had seen in the gothic boudoir . She stopped me by a smile , made me sit beside her , and talked about my work , seeming to take the greatest interest in it , and all the more when I set forth my theories amusingly , instead of adopting the formal language of a professor for their explanation . It seemed to divert her to be told that the human will was a material force like steam ; that in the moral world nothing could resist its power if a man taught himself to concentrate it , to economize it , and to project continually its fluid mass in given directions upon other souls . Such a man , I said , could modify all things relatively to man , even the peremptory laws of nature . The questions Foedora raised showed a certain keenness of intellect . I took a pleasure in deciding some of them in her favor , in order to flatter her ; then I confuted her feminine reasoning with a word , and roused her curiosity by drawing her attention to an everyday matter -- to sleep , a thing so apparently commonplace , that in reality is an insoluble problem for science . The countess sat in silence for a moment when I told her that our ideas were complete organic beings , existing in an invisible world , and influencing our destinies ; and for witnesses I cited the opinions of Descartes , Diderot , and Napoleon , who had directed , and still directed , all the currents of the age .
43004	43573	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" So I had the honor of amusing this woman ; who asked me to come to see her when she left me ; giving me _ les grande entrees _ , in the language of the court . Whether it was by dint of substituting polite formulas for genuine expressions of feeling , a commendable habit of mine , or because Foedora hailed in me a coming celebrity , an addition to her learned menagerie ; for some reason I thought that I had pleased her . I called all my previous physiological studies and knowledge of woman to my aid , and minutely scrutinized this singular person and her ways all evening . I concealed myself in the embrasure of a window , and sought to discover her thoughts from her bearing . I studied the tactics of the mistress of the house , as she came and went , sat and chatted , beckoned to this one or that , asked questions , listened to the answers , as she leaned against the frame of the door ; I detected a languid charm in her movements , a grace in the flutterings of her dress , remarked the nature of the feelings she so powerfully excited , and became very incredulous as to her virtue . If Foedora would none of love to - day , she had had strong passions at some time ; past experience of pleasure showed itself in the attitudes she chose in conversation , in her coquettish way of leaning against the panel behind her ; she seemed scarcely able to stand alone , and yet ready for flight from too bold a glance . There was a kind of eloquence about her lightly folded arms , which , even for benevolent eyes , breathed sentiment . Her fresh red lips sharply contrasted with her brilliantly pale complexion . Her brown hair brought out all the golden color in her eyes , in which blue streaks mingled as in Florentine marble ; their expression seemed to increase the significance of her words . A studied grace lay in the charms of her bodice . Perhaps a rival might have found the lines of the thick eyebrows , which almost met , a little hard ; or found a fault in the almost invisible down that covered her features . I saw the signs of passion everywhere , written on those Italian eyelids , on the splendid shoulders worthy of the Venus of Milo , on her features , in the darker shade of down above a somewhat thick under - lip . She was not merely a woman , but a romance . The whole blended harmony of lines , the feminine luxuriance of her frame , and its passionate promise , were subdued by a constant inexplicable reserve and modesty at variance with everything else about her . It needed an observation as keen as my own to detect such signs as these in her character . To explain myself more clearly ; there were two women in Foedora , divided perhaps by the line between head and body : the one , the head alone , seemed to be susceptible , and the other phlegmatic . She prepared her glance before she looked at you , something unspeakably mysterious , some inward convulsion seemed revealed by her glittering eyes .
43574	43636	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" So , to be brief , either my imperfect moral science had left me a good deal to learn in the moral world , or a lofty soul dwelt in the countess , lent to her face those charms that fascinated and subdued us , and gave her an ascendency only the more complete because it comprehended a sympathy of desire .
43637	43780	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I went away completely enraptured with this woman , dazzled by the luxury around her , gratified in every faculty of my soul -- noble and base , good and evil . When I felt myself so excited , eager , and elated , I thought I understood the attraction that drew thither those artists , diplomatists , men in office , those stock - jobbers encased in triple brass . They came , no doubt , to find in her society the delirious emotion that now thrilled through every fibre in me , throbbing through my brain , setting the blood a - tingle in every vein , fretting even the tiniest nerve . And she had given herself to none , so as to keep them all . A woman is a coquette so long as she knows not love .
43781	43819	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Well , ' I said to Rastignac , ' they married her , or sold her perhaps , to some old man , and recollections of her first marriage have caused her aversion for love . '
43820	44021	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I walked home from the Faubourg St. Honore , where Foedora lived . Almost all the breadth of Paris lies between her mansion and the Rue des Cordiers , but the distance seemed short , in spite of the cold . And I was to lay siege to Foedora 's heart , in winter , and a bitter winter , with only thirty francs in my possession , and such a distance as that lay between us ! Only a poor man knows what such a passion costs in cab - hire , gloves , linen , tailor 's bills , and the like . If the Platonic stage lasts a little too long , the affair grows ruinous . As a matter of fact , there is many a Lauzun among students of law , who finds it impossible to approach a ladylove living on a first floor . And I , sickly , thin , poorly dressed , wan and pale as any artist convalescent after a work , how could I compete with other young men , curled , handsome , smart , outcravatting Croatia ; wealthy men , equipped with tilburys , and armed with assurance ?
44022	44049	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Bah , death or Foedora ! ' I cried , as I went round by a bridge ; ' my fortune lies in Foedora . '
44050	44220	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" That gothic boudoir and Louis Quatorze salon came before my eyes . I saw the countess again in her white dress with its large graceful sleeves , and all the fascinations of her form and movements . These pictures of Foedora and her luxurious surroundings haunted me even in my bare , cold garret , when at last I reached it , as disheveled as any naturalist 's wig . The contrast suggested evil counsel ; in such a way crimes are conceived . I cursed my honest , self - respecting poverty , my garret where such teeming fancies had stirred within me . I trembled with fury , I reproached God , the devil , social conditions , my own father , the whole universe , indeed , with my fate and my misfortunes . I went hungry to bed , muttering ludicrous imprecations , but fully determined to win Foedora . Her heart was my last ticket in the lottery , my fortune depended upon it .
44221	44317	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I spare you the history of my earlier visits , to reach the drama the sooner . In my efforts to appeal to her , I essayed to engage her intellect and her vanity on my side ; in order to secure her love , I gave her any quantity of reasons for increasing her self - esteem ; I never left her in a state of indifference ; women like emotions at any cost , I gave them to her in plenty ; I would rather have had her angry with me than indifferent .
44318	44365	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" At first , urged by a strong will and a desire for her love , I assumed a little authority , but my own feelings grew stronger and mastered me ; I relapsed into truth , I lost my head , and fell desperately in love .
44366	44522	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I am not very sure what we mean by the word love in our poetry and our talk ; but I know that I have never found in all the ready rhetorical phrases of Jean - Jacques Rousseau , in whose room perhaps I was lodging ; nor among the feeble inventions of two centuries of our literature , nor in any picture that Italy has produced , a representation of the feelings that expanded all at once in my double nature . The view of the lake of Bienne , some music of Rossini 's , the Madonna of Murillo 's now in the possession of General Soult , Lescombat 's letters , a few sayings scattered through collections of anecdotes ; but most of all the prayers of religious ecstatics , and passages in our _ fabliaux_,--these things alone have power to carry me back to the divine heights of my first love .
44523	44708	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Nothing expressed in human language , no thought reproducible in color , marble , sound , or articulate speech , could ever render the force , the truth , the completeness , the suddenness with which love awoke in me . To speak of art , is to speak of illusion . Love passes through endless transformations before it passes for ever into our existence and makes it glow with its own color of flame . The process is imperceptible , and baffles the artist 's analysis . Its moans and complaints are tedious to an uninterested spectator . One would need to be very much in love to share the furious transports of Lovelace , as one reads _ Clarissa Harlowe _ . Love is like some fresh spring , that leaves its cresses , its gravel bed and flowers to become first a stream and then a river , changing its aspect and its nature as it flows to plunge itself in some boundless ocean , where restricted natures only find monotony , but where great souls are engulfed in endless contemplation .
44709	45202	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" How can I dare to describe the hues of fleeting emotions , the nothings beyond all price , the spoken accents that beggar language , the looks that hold more than all the wealth of poetry ? Not one of the mysterious scenes that draw us insensibly nearer and nearer to a woman , but has depths in it which can swallow up all the poetry that ever was written . How can the inner life and mystery that stirs in our souls penetrate through our glozes , when we have not even words to describe the visible and outward mysteries of beauty ? What enchantment steeped me for how many hours in unspeakable rapture , filled with the sight of Her ! What made me happy ? I know not . That face of hers overflowed with light at such times ; it seemed in some way to glow with it ; the outlines of her face , with the scarcely perceptible down on its delicate surface , shone with a beauty belonging to the far distant horizon that melts into the sunlight . The light of day seemed to caress her as she mingled in it ; rather it seemed that the light of her eyes was brighter than the daylight itself ; or some shadow passing over that fair face made a kind of change there , altering its hues and its expression . Some thought would often seem to glow on her white brows ; her eyes appeared to dilate , and her eyelids trembled ; a smile rippled over her features ; the living coral of her lips grew full of meaning as they closed and unclosed ; an indistinguishable something in her hair made brown shadows on her fair temples ; in each new phase Foedora spoke . Every slight variation in her beauty made a new pleasure for my eyes , disclosed charms my heart had never known before ; I tried to read a separate emotion or a hope in every change that passed over her face . This mute converse passed between soul and soul , like sound and answering echo ; and the short - lived delights then showered upon me have left indelible impressions behind . Her voice would cause a frenzy in me that I could hardly understand . I could have copied the example of some prince of Lorraine , and held a live coal in the hollow of my hand , if her fingers passed caressingly through my hair the while . I felt no longer mere admiration and desire : I was under the spell ; I had met my destiny . When back again under my own roof , I still vaguely saw Foedora in her own home , and had some indefinable share in her life ; if she felt ill , I suffered too . The next day I used to say to her :
45203	45211	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You were not well yesterday . '
45212	45328	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" How often has she not stood before me , called by the power of ecstasy , in the silence of the night ! Sometimes she would break in upon me like a ray of light , make me drop my pen , and put science and study to flight in grief and alarm , as she compelled my admiration by the alluring pose I had seen but a short time before . Sometimes I went to seek her in the spirit world , and would bow down to her as to a hope , entreating her to let me hear the silver sounds of her voice , and I would wake at length in tears .
45329	45823	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Once , when she had promised to go to the theatre with me , she took it suddenly into her head to refuse to go out , and begged me to leave her alone . I was in such despair over the perversity which cost me a day 's work , and ( if I must confess it ) my last shilling as well , that I went alone where she was to have been , desiring to see the play she had wished to see . I had scarcely seated myself when an electric shock went through me . A voice told me , ' She is here ! ' I looked round , and saw the countess hidden in the shadow at the back of her box in the first tier . My look did not waver ; my eyes saw her at once with incredible clearness ; my soul hovered about her life like an insect above its flower . How had my senses received this warning ? There is something in these inward tremors that shallow people find astonishing , but the phenomena of our inner consciousness are produced as simple as those of external vision ; so I was not surprised , but much vexed . My studies of our mental faculties , so little understood , helped me at any rate to find in my own excitement some living proofs of my theories . There was something exceedingly odd in this combination of lover and man of science , of downright idolatry of a woman with the love of knowledge . The causes of the lover 's despair were highly interesting to the man of science ; and the exultant lover , on the other hand , put science far away from him in his joy . Foedora saw me , and grew grave : I annoyed her . I went to her box during the first interval , and finding her alone , I stayed there . Although we had not spoken of love , I foresaw an explanation . I had not told her my secret , still there was a kind of understanding between us . She used to tell me her plans for amusement , and on the previous evening had asked with friendly eagerness if I meant to call the next day . After any witticism of hers , she would give me an inquiring glance , as if she had sought to please me alone by it . She would soothe me if I was vexed ; and if she pouted , I had in some sort a right to ask an explanation . Before she would pardon any blunder , she would keep me a suppliant for long . All these things that we so relished , were so many lovers ' quarrels . What arch grace she threw into it all ! and what happiness it was to me !
45824	45855	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" But now we stood before each other as strangers , with the close relation between us both suspended . The countess was glacial : a presentiment of trouble filled me .
45856	45874	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Will you come home with me ? ' she said , when the play was over .
45875	46132	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" There had been a sudden change in the weather , and sleet was falling in showers as we went out . Foedora 's carriage was unable to reach the doorway of the theatre . At the sight of a well - dressed woman about to cross the street , a commissionaire held an umbrella above us , and stood waiting at the carriage - door for his tip . I would have given ten years of life just then for a couple of halfpence , but I had not a penny . All the man in me and all my vainest susceptibilities were wrung with an infernal pain . The words , ' I have n't a penny about me , my good fellow ! ' came from me in the hard voice of thwarted passion ; and yet I was that man 's brother in misfortune , as I knew too well ; and once I had so lightly paid away seven hundred thousand francs ! The footman pushed the man aside , and the horses sprang forward . As we returned , Foedora , in real or feigned abstraction , answered all my questions curtly and by monosyllables . I said no more ; it was a hateful moment . When we reached her house , we seated ourselves by the hearth , and when the servant had stirred the fire and left us alone , the countess turned to me with an inexplicable expression , and spoke . Her manner was almost solemn .
46133	46370	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Since my return to France , more than one young man , tempted by my money , has made proposals to me which would have satisfied my pride . I have come across men , too , whose attachment was so deep and sincere that they might have married me even if they had found me the penniless girl I used to be . Besides these , Monsieur de Valentin , you must know that new titles and newly - acquired wealth have been also offered to me , and that I have never received again any of those who were so ill - advised as to mention love to me . If my regard for you was but slight , I would not give you this warning , which is dictated by friendship rather than by pride . A woman lays herself open to a rebuff of some kind , if she imagines herself to be loved , and declines , before it is uttered , to listen to language which in its nature implies a compliment . I am well acquainted with the parts played by Arsinoe and Araminta , and with the sort of answer I might look for under such circumstances ; but I hope to - day that I shall not find myself misconstrued by a man of no ordinary character , because I have frankly spoken my mind . '
46371	46579	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She spoke with the cool self - possession of some attorney or solicitor explaining the nature of a contract or the conduct of a lawsuit to a client . There was not the least sign of feeling in the clear soft tones of her voice . Her steady face and dignified bearing seemed to me now full of diplomatic reserve and coldness . She had planned this scene , no doubt , and carefully chosen her words beforehand . Oh , my friend , there are women who take pleasure in piercing hearts , and deliberately plunge the dagger back again into the wound ; such women as these can not but be worshiped , for such women either love or would fain be loved . A day comes when they make amends for all the pain they gave us ; they repay us for the pangs , the keenness of which they recognize , in joys a hundred - fold , even as God , they tell us , recompenses our good works . Does not their perversity spring from the strength of their feelings ? But to be so tortured by a woman , who slaughters you with indifference ! was not the suffering hideous ?
46580	46627	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Foedora did not know it , but in that minute she trampled all my hopes beneath her feet ; she maimed my life and she blighted my future with the cool indifference and unconscious barbarity of an inquisitive child who plucks its wings from a butterfly .
46628	46719	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Later on , ' resumed Foedora , ' you will learn , I hope , the stability of the affection that I keep for my friends . You will always find that I have devotion and kindness for them . I would give my life to serve my friends ; but you could only despise me , if I allowed them to make love to me without return . That is enough . You are the only man to whom I have spoken such words as these last . '
46720	46754	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" At first I could not speak , or master the tempest that arose within me ; but I soon repressed my emotions in the depths of my soul , and began to smile .
46755	47168	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' If I own that I love you , ' I said , ' you will banish me at once ; if I plead guilty to indifference , you will make me suffer for it . Women , magistrates , and priests never quite lay the gown aside . Silence is non - committal ; be pleased then , madame , to approve my silence . You must have feared , in some degree , to lose me , or I should not have received this friendly admonition ; and with that thought my pride ought to be satisfied . Let us banish all personal considerations . You are perhaps the only woman with whom I could discuss rationally a resolution so contrary to the laws of nature . Considered with regard to your species , you are a prodigy . Now let us investigate , in good faith , the causes of this psychological anomaly . Does there exist in you , as in many women , a certain pride in self , a love of your own loveliness , a refinement of egoism which makes you shudder at the idea of belonging to another ; is it the thought of resigning your own will and submitting to a superiority , though only of convention , which displeases you ? You would seem to me a thousand times fairer for it . Can love formerly have brought you suffering ? You probably set some value on your dainty figure and graceful appearance , and may perhaps wish to avoid the disfigurements of maternity . Is not this one of your strongest reasons for refusing a too importunate love ? Some natural defect perhaps makes you insusceptible in spite of yourself ? Do not be angry ; my study , my inquiry is absolutely dispassionate . Some are born blind , and nature may easily have formed women who in like manner are blind , deaf , and dumb to love . You are really an interesting subject for medical investigation . You do not know your value . You feel perhaps a very legitimate distaste for mankind ; in that I quite concur -- to me they all seem ugly and detestable . And you are right , ' I added , feeling my heart swell within me ; ' how can you do otherwise than despise us ? There is not a man living who is worthy of you . '
47169	47246	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I will not repeat all the biting words with which I ridiculed her . In vain ; my bitterest sarcasms and keenest irony never made her wince nor elicited a sign of vexation . She heard me , with the customary smile upon her lips and in her eyes , the smile that she wore as a part of her clothing , and that never varied for friends , for mere acquaintances , or for strangers .
47247	47328	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Is n't it very nice of me to allow you to dissect me like this ? ' she said at last , as I came to a temporary standstill , and looked at her in silence . ' You see , ' she went on , laughing , ' that I have no foolish over - sensitiveness about my friendship . Many a woman would shut her door on you by way of punishing you for your impertinence . '
47329	47361	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You could banish me without needing to give me the reasons for your harshness . ' As I spoke I felt that I could kill her if she dismissed me .
47362	47374	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are mad , ' she said , smiling still .
47375	47404	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Did you never think , ' I went on , ' of the effects of passionate love ? A desperate man has often murdered his mistress . '
47405	47449	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' It is better to die than to live in misery , ' she said coolly . ' Such a man as that would run through his wife 's money , desert her , and leave her at last in utter wretchedness . '
47450	47471	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" This calm calculation dumfounded me . The gulf between us was made plain ; we could never understand each other .
47472	47482	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Good - bye , ' I said proudly .
47483	47503	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Good - bye , till to - morrow , ' she answered , with a little friendly bow .
47504	47655	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" For a moment 's space I hurled at her in a glance all the love I must forego ; she stood there with than banal smile of hers , the detestable chill smile of a marble statue , with none of the warmth in it that it seemed to express . Can you form any idea , my friend , of the pain that overcame me on the way home through rain and snow , across a league of icy - sheeted quays , without a hope left ? Oh , to think that she not only had not guessed my poverty , but believed me to be as wealthy as she was , and likewise borne as softly over the rough ways of life ! What failure and deceit ! It was no mere question of money now , but of the fate of all that lay within me .
47656	47740	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I went at haphazard , going over the words of our strange conversation with myself . I got so thoroughly lost in my reflections that I ended by doubts as to the actual value of words and ideas . But I loved her all the same ; I loved this woman with the untouched heart that might surrender at any moment -- a woman who daily disappointed the expectations of the previous evening , by appearing as a new mistress on the morrow .
47741	47931	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" As I passed under the gateway of the Institute , a fevered thrill ran through me . I remembered that I was fasting , and that I had not a penny . To complete the measure of my misfortune , my hat was spoiled by the rain . How was I to appear in the drawing - room of a woman of fashion with an unpresentable hat ? I had always cursed the inane and stupid custom that compels us to exhibit the lining of our hats , and to keep them always in our hands , but with anxious care I had so far kept mine in a precarious state of efficiency . It had been neither strikingly new , nor utterly shabby , neither napless nor over - glossy , and might have passed for the hat of a frugally given owner , but its artificially prolonged existence had now reached the final stage , it was crumpled , forlorn , and completely ruined , a downright rag , a fitting emblem of its master . My painfully preserved elegance must collapse for want of thirty sous .
47932	48114	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" What unrecognized sacrifices I had made in the past three months for Foedora ! How often I had given the price of a week 's sustenance to see her for a moment ! To leave my work and go without food was the least of it ! I must traverse the streets of Paris without getting splashed , run to escape showers , and reach her rooms at last , as neat and spruce as any of the coxcombs about her . For a poet and a distracted wooer the difficulties of this task were endless . My happiness , the course of my love , might be affected by a speck of mud upon my only white waistcoat ! Oh , to miss the sight of her because I was wet through and bedraggled , and had not so much as five sous to give to a shoeblack for removing the least little spot of mud from my boot ! The petty pangs of these nameless torments , which an irritable man finds so great , only strengthened my passion .
48115	48312	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The unfortunate must make sacrifices which they may not mention to women who lead refined and luxurious lives . Such women see things through a prism that gilds all men and their surroundings . Egoism leads them to take cheerful views , and fashion makes them cruel ; they do not wish to reflect , lest they lose their happiness , and the absorbing nature of their pleasures absolves their indifference to the misfortunes of others . A penny never means millions to them ; millions , on the contrary , seem a mere trifle . Perhaps love must plead his cause by great sacrifices , but a veil must be lightly drawn across them , they must go down into silence . So when wealthy men pour out their devotion , their fortunes , and their lives , they gain somewhat by these commonly entertained opinions , an additional lustre hangs about their lovers ' follies ; their silence is eloquent ; there is a grace about the drawn veil ; but my terrible distress bound me over to suffer fearfully or ever I might speak of my love or of dying for her sake .
48313	48520	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Was it a sacrifice after all ? Was I not richly rewarded by the joy I took in sacrificing everything to her ? There was no commonest event of my daily life to which the countess had not given importance , had not overfilled with happiness . I had been hitherto careless of my clothes , now I respected my coat as if it had been a second self . I should not have hesitated between bodily harm and a tear in that garment . You must enter wholly into my circumstances to understand the stormy thoughts , the gathering frenzy , that shook me as I went , and which , perhaps , were increased by my walk . I gloated in an infernal fashion which I can not describe over the absolute completeness of my wretchedness . I would have drawn from it an augury of my future , but there is no limit to the possibilities of misfortune . The door of my lodging - house stood ajar . A light streamed from the heart - shaped opening cut in the shutters . Pauline and her mother were sitting up for me and talking . I heard my name spoken , and listened .
48521	48618	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Raphael is much nicer - looking than the student in number seven , ' said Pauline ; ' his fair hair is such a pretty color . Do n't you think there is something in his voice , too , I do n't know what it is , that gives you a sort of a thrill ? And , then , though he may be a little proud , he is very kind , and he has such fine manners ; I am sure that all the ladies must be quite wild about him . '
48619	48640	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You might be fond of him yourself , to hear you talk , ' was Madame Gaudin 's comment .
48641	48726	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' He is just as dear to me as a brother , ' she laughed . ' I should be finely ungrateful if I felt no friendship for him . Did n't he teach me music and drawing and grammar , and everything I know in fact ? You do n't much notice how I get on , dear mother ; but I shall know enough , in a while , to give lessons myself , and then we can keep a servant . '
48727	48999	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I stole away softly , made some noise outside , and went into their room to take the lamp , that Pauline tried to light for me . The dear child had just poured soothing balm into my wounds . Her outspoken admiration had given me fresh courage . I so needed to believe in myself and to come by a just estimate of my advantages . This revival of hope in me perhaps colored my surroundings . Perhaps also I had never before really looked at the picture that so often met my eyes , of the two women in their room ; it was a scene such as Flemish painters have reproduced so faithfully for us , that I admired in its delightful reality . The mother , with the kind smile upon her lips , sat knitting stockings by the dying fire ; Pauline was painting hand - screens , her brushes and paints , strewn over the tiny table , made bright spots of color for the eye to dwell on . When she had left her seat and stood lighting my lamp , one must have been under the yoke of a terrible passion indeed , not to admire her faintly flushed transparent hands , the girlish charm of her attitude , the ideal grace of her head , as the lamplight fell full on her pale face . Night and silence added to the charms of this industrious vigil and peaceful interior . The light - heartedness that sustained such continuous toil could only spring from devout submission and the lofty feelings that it brings .
49000	49147	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" There was an indescribable harmony between them and their possessions . The splendor of Foedora 's home did not satisfy ; it called out all my worst instincts ; something in this lowly poverty and unfeigned goodness revived me . It may have been that luxury abased me in my own eyes , while here my self - respect was restored to me , as I sought to extend the protection that a man is so eager to make felt , over these two women , who in the bare simplicity of the existence in their brown room seemed to live wholly in the feelings of their hearts . As I came up to Pauline , she looked at me in an almost motherly way ; her hands shook a little as she held the lamp , so that the light fell on me and cried :
49148	49215	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' _ Dieu _ ! how pale you are ! and you are wet through ! My mother will try to wipe you dry . Monsieur Raphael , ' she went on , after a little pause , ' you are so very fond of milk , and to - night we happen to have some cream . Here , will you not take some ? '
49216	49248	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She pounced like a kitten , on a china bowl full of milk . She did it so quickly , and put it before me so prettily , that I hesitated .
49249	49266	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are going to refuse me ? ' she said , and her tones changed .
49267	49334	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The pride in each felt for the other 's pride . It was Pauline 's poverty that seemed to humiliate her , and to reproach me with my want of consideration , and I melted at once and accepted the cream that might have been meant for her morning 's breakfast . The poor child tried not to show her joy , but her eyes sparkled .
49335	49389	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I needed it badly , ' I said as I sat down . ( An anxious look passed over her face . ) ' Do you remember that passage , Pauline , where Bossuet tells how God gave more abundant reward for a cup of cold water than for a victory ? '
49390	49411	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Yes , ' she said , her heart beating like some wild bird 's in a child 's hands .
49412	49458	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Well , as we shall part very soon , now , ' I went on in an unsteady voice , ' you must let me show my gratitude to you and to your mother for all the care you have taken of me . '
49459	49495	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Oh , do n't let us cast accounts , ' she said laughing . But her laughter covered an agitation that gave me pain . I went on without appearing to hear her words :
49496	49537	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' My piano is one of Erard 's best instruments ; and you must take it . Pray accept it without hesitation ; I really could not take it with me on the journey I am about to make . '
49538	49594	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Perhaps the melancholy tones in which I spoke enlightened the two women , for they seemed to understand , and eyed me with curiosity and alarm . Here was the affection that I had looked for in the glacial regions of the great world , true affection , unostentatious but tender , and possibly lasting .
49595	49742	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Do n't take it to heart so , ' the mother said ; ' stay on here . My husband is on his way towards us even now , ' she went on . ' I looked into the Gospel of St. John this evening while Pauline hung our door - key in a Bible from her fingers . The key turned ; that means that Gaudin is in health and doing well . Pauline began again for you and for the young man in number seven -- it turned for you , but not for him . We are all going to be rich . Gaudin will come back a millionaire . I dreamed once that I saw him in a ship full of serpents ; luckily the water was rough , and that means gold or precious stones from over - sea . '
49743	49855	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The silly , friendly words were like the crooning lullaby with which a mother soothes her sick child ; they in a manner calmed me . There was a pleasant heartiness in the worthy woman 's looks and tones , which , if it could not remove trouble , at any rate soothed and quieted it , and deadened the pain . Pauline , keener - sighted than her mother , studied me uneasily ; her quick eyes seemed to read my life and my future . I thanked the mother and daughter by an inclination of the head , and hurried away ; I was afraid I should break down .
49856	50102	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I found myself alone under my roof , and laid myself down in my misery . My unhappy imagination suggested numberless baseless projects , and prescribed impossible resolutions . When a man is struggling in the wreck of his fortunes , he is not quite without resources , but I was engulfed . Ah , my dear fellow , we are too ready to blame the wretched . Let us be less harsh on the results of the most powerful of all social solvents . Where poverty is absolute there exist no such things as shame or crime , or virtue or intelligence . I knew not what to do ; I was as defenceless as a maiden on her knees before a beast of prey . A penniless man who has no ties to bind him is master of himself at any rate , but a luckless wretch who is in love no longer belongs to himself , and may not take his own life . Love makes us almost sacred in our own eyes ; it is the life of another that we revere within us ; then and so it begins for us the cruelest trouble of all -- the misery with a hope in it , a hope for which we must even bear our torments . I thought I would go to Rastignac on the morrow to confide Foedora 's strange resolution to him , and with that I slept .
50103	50185	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Ah , ha ! ' cried Rastignac , as he saw me enter his lodging at nine o'clock in the morning . ' I know what brings you here . Foedora has dismissed you . Some kind souls , who were jealous of your ascendency over the countess , gave out that you were going to be married . Heaven only knows what follies your rivals have equipped you with , and what slanders have been directed at you . '
50186	50246	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' That explains everything ! ' I exclaimed . I remembered all my presumptuous speeches , and gave the countess credit for no little magnanimity . It pleased me to think that I was a miscreant who had not been punished nearly enough , and I saw nothing in her indulgence but the long - suffering charity of love .
50247	50403	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Not quite so fast , ' urged the prudent Gascon ; ' Foedora has all the sagacity natural to a profoundly selfish woman ; perhaps she may have taken your measure while you still coveted only her money and her splendor ; in spite of all your care , she could have read you through and through . She can dissemble far too well to let any dissimulation pass undetected . I fear , ' he went on , ' that I have brought you into a bad way . In spite of her cleverness and her tact , she seems to me a domineering sort of person , like every woman who can only feel pleasure through her brain . Happiness for her lies entirely in a comfortable life and in social pleasures ; her sentiment is only assumed ; she will make you miserable ; you will be her head footman . '
50404	50432	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" He spoke to the deaf . I broke in upon him , disclosing , with an affectation of light - heartedness , the state of my finances .
50433	50491	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Yesterday evening , ' he rejoined , ' luck ran against me , and that carried off all my available cash . But for that trivial mishap , I would gladly have shared my purse with you . But let us go and breakfast at the restaurant ; perhaps there is good counsel in oysters . '
50492	50608	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" He dressed , and had his tilbury brought round . We went to the Cafe de Paris like a couple of millionaires , armed with all the audacious impertinence of the speculator whose capital is imaginary . That devil of a Gascon quite disconcerted me by the coolness of his manners and his absolute self - possession . While we were taking coffee after an excellent and well - ordered repast , a young dandy entered , who did not escape Rastignac . He had been nodding here and there among the crowd to this or that young man , distinguished both by personal attractions and elegant attire , and now he said to me :
50609	50640	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Here 's your man , ' as he beckoned to this gentleman with a wonderful cravat , who seemed to be looking for a table that suited his ideas .
50641	50747	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' That rogue has been decorated for bringing out books that he does n't understand a word of , ' whispered Rastignac ; ' he is a chemist , a historian , a novelist , and a political writer ; he has gone halves , thirds , or quarters in the authorship of I do n't know how many plays , and he is as ignorant as Dom Miguel 's mule . He is not a man so much as a name , a label that the public is familiar with . So he would do well to avoid shops inscribed with the motto , "
50758	50817	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" He is acute enough to deceive an entire congress of diplomatists . In a couple of words , he is a moral half - caste , not quite a fraud , nor entirely genuine . But , hush ! he has succeeded already ; nobody asks anything further , and every one calls him an illustrious man . '
50818	50849	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Well , my esteemed and excellent friend , and how may Your Intelligence be ? ' So Rastignac addressed the stranger as he sat down at a neighboring table .
50850	50914	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Neither well nor ill ; I am overwhelmed with work . I have all the necessary materials for some very curious historical memoirs in my hands , and I can not find any one to whom I can ascribe them . It worries me , for I shall have to be quick about it . Memoirs are falling out of fashion . '
50915	50935	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' What are the memoirs -- contemporaneous , ancient , or memoirs of the court , or what ? '
50936	50945	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' They relate to the Necklace affair . '
50946	50979	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Now , is n't that a coincidence ? ' said Rastignac , turning to me and laughing . He looked again to the literary speculation , and said , indicating me :
50980	51039	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' This is M. de Valentin , one of my friends , whom I must introduce to you as one of our future literary celebrities . He had formerly an aunt , a marquise , much in favor once at court , and for about two years he has been writing a Royalist history of the Revolution . '
51040	51054	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Then , bending over this singular man of business , he went on :
51055	51088	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' He is a man of talent , and a simpleton that will do your memoirs for you , in his aunt 's name , for a hundred crowns a volume . '
51089	51111	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' It 's a bargain , ' said the other , adjusting his cravat . ' Waiter , my oysters . '
51112	51142	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Yes , but you must give me twenty - five louis as commission , and you will pay him in advance for each volume , ' said Rastignac .
51143	51170	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' No , no . He shall only have fifty crowns on account , and then I shall be sure of having my manuscript punctually . '
51171	51197	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Rastignac repeated this business conversation to me in low tones ; and then , without giving me any voice in the matter , he replied :
51198	51217	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' We agree to your proposal . When can we call upon you to arrange the affair ? '
51218	51235	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Oh , well ! Come and dine here to - morrow at seven o'clock . '
51236	51282	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" We rose . Rastignac flung some money to the waiter , put the bill in his pocket , and we went out . I was quite stupified by the flippancy and ease with which he had sold my venerable aunt , la Marquise de Montbauron .
51283	51318	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I would sooner take ship for the Brazils , and give the Indians lessons in algebra , though I do n't know a word of it , than tarnish my family name . '
51319	51324	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Rastignac burst out laughing .
51325	51438	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' How dense you are ! Take the fifty crowns in the first instance , and write the memoirs . When you have finished them , you will decline to publish them in your aunt 's name , imbecile ! Madame de Montbauron , with her hooped petticoat , her rank and beauty , rouge and slippers , and her death upon the scaffold , is worth a great deal more than six hundred francs . And then , if the trade will not give your aunt her due , some old adventurer , or some shady countess or other , will be found to put her name to the memoirs . '
51439	51469	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Oh , ' I groaned ; ' why did I quit the blameless life in my garret ? This world has aspects that are very vilely dishonorable . '
51470	51620	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Yes , ' said Rastignac , ' that is all very poetical , but this is a matter of business . What a child you are ! Now , listen to me . As to your work , the public will decide upon it ; and as for my literary middle - man , has n't he devoted eight years of his life to obtaining a footing in the book - trade , and paid heavily for his experience ? You divide the money and the labor of the book with him very unequally , but is n't yours the better part ? Twenty - five louis means as much to you as a thousand francs does to him . Come , you can write historical memoirs , a work of art such as never was , since Diderot once wrote six sermons for a hundred crowns ! '
51621	51666	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' After all , ' I said , in agitation , ' I can not choose but do it . So , my dear friend , my thanks are due to you . I shall be quite rich with twenty - five louis . '
51667	51901	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Richer than you think , ' he laughed . ' If I have my commission from Finot in this matter , it goes to you , ca n't you see ? Now let us go to the Bois de Boulogne , ' he said ; ' we shall see your countess there , and I will show you the pretty little widow that I am to marry -- a charming woman , an Alsacienne , rather plump . She reads Kant , Schiller , Jean Paul , and a host of lachrymose books . She has a mania for continually asking my opinion , and I have to look as if I entered into all this German sensibility , and to know a pack of ballads -- drugs , all of them , that my doctor absolutely prohibits . As yet I have not been able to wean her from her literary enthusiasms ; she sheds torrents of tears as she reads Goethe , and I have to weep a little myself to please her , for she has an income of fifty thousand livres , my dear boy , and the prettiest little hand and foot in the world . Oh , if she would only say _ mon ange _ and _ brouiller _ instead of _ mon anche _ and _ prouiller _ , she would be perfection ! '
51902	52008	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" We saw the countess , radiant amid the splendors of her equipage . The coquette bowed very graciously to us both , and the smile she gave me seemed to me to be divine and full of love . I was very happy ; I fancied myself beloved ; I had money , a wealth of love in my heart , and my troubles were over . I was light - hearted , blithe , and content . I found my friend 's lady - love charming . Earth and air and heaven -- all nature -- seemed to reflect Foedora 's smile for me .
52009	52189	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" As we returned through the Champs - Elysees , we paid a visit to Rastignac 's hatter and tailor . Thanks to the ' Necklace , ' my insignificant peace - footing was to end , and I made formidable preparations for a campaign . Henceforward I need not shrink from a contest with the spruce and fashionable young men who made Foedora 's circle . I went home , locked myself in , and stood by my dormer window , outwardly calm enough , but in reality I bade a last good - bye to the roofs without . I began to live in the future , rehearsed my life drama , and discounted love and its happiness . Ah , how stormy life can grow to be within the four walls of a garret ! The soul within us is like a fairy ; she turns straw into diamonds for us ; and for us , at a touch of her wand , enchanted palaces arise , as flowers in the meadows spring up towards the sun .
52190	52241	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Towards noon , next day , Pauline knocked gently at my door , and brought me -- who could guess it?--a note from Foedora . The countess asked me to take her to the Luxembourg , and to go thence to see with her the Museum and Jardin des Plantes .
52242	52262	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' The man is waiting for an answer , ' said Pauline , after quietly waiting for a moment .
52263	52305	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I hastily scrawled my acknowledgements , and Pauline took the note . I changed my dress . When my toilette was ended , and I looked at myself with some complaisance , an icy shiver ran through me as I thought :
52306	52368	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Will Foedora walk or drive ? Will it rain or shine?--No matter , though , ' I said to myself ; ' whichever it is , can one ever reckon with feminine caprice ? She will have no money about her , and will want to give a dozen francs to some little Savoyard because his rags are picturesque . '
52369	52669	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I had not a brass farthing , and should have no money till the evening came . How dearly a poet pays for the intellectual prowess that method and toil have brought him , at such crises of our youth ! Innumerable painfully vivid thoughts pierced me like barbs . I looked out of my window ; the weather was very unsettled . If things fell out badly , I might easily hire a cab for the day ; but would not the fear lie on me every moment that I might not meet Finot in the evening ? I felt too weak to endure such fears in the midst of my felicity . Though I felt sure that I should find nothing , I began a grand search through my room ; I looked for imaginary coins in the recesses of my mattress ; I hunted about everywhere -- I even shook out my old boots . A nervous fever seized me ; I looked with wild eyes at the furniture when I had ransacked it all . Will you understand , I wonder , the excitement that possessed me when , plunged deep in the listlessness of despair , I opened my writing - table drawer , and found a fair and splendid ten - franc piece that shone like a rising star , new and sparkling , and slily hiding in a cranny between two boards ? I did not try to account for its previous reserve and the cruelty of which it had been guilty in thus lying hidden ; I kissed it for a friend faithful in adversity , and hailed it with a cry that found an echo , and made me turn sharply , to find Pauline with a face grown white .
52670	52775	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I thought , ' she faltered , ' that you had hurt yourself ! The man who brought the letter---- ' ( she broke off as if something smothered her voice ) . ' But mother has paid him , ' she added , and flitted away like a wayward , capricious child . Poor little one ! I wanted her to share in my happiness . I seemed to have all the happiness in the world within me just then ; and I would fain have returned to the unhappy , all that I felt as if I had stolen from them .
52776	52828	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The intuitive perception of adversity is sound for the most part ; the countess had sent away her carriage . One of those freaks that pretty women can scarcely explain to themselves had determined her to go on foot , by way of the boulevards , to the Jardin des Plantes .
52829	52847	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' It will rain , ' I told her , and it pleased her to contradict me .
52848	53126	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" As it fell out , the weather was fine while we went through the Luxembourg ; when we came out , some drops fell from a great cloud , whose progress I had watched uneasily , and we took a cab . At the Museum I was about to dismiss the vehicle , and Foedora ( what agonies ! ) asked me not to do so . But it was like a dream in broad daylight for me , to chat with her , to wander in the Jardin des Plantes , to stray down the shady alleys , to feel her hand upon my arm ; the secret transports repressed in me were reduced , no doubt , to a fixed and foolish smile upon my lips ; there was something unreal about it all . Yet in all her movements , however alluring , whether we stood or whether we walked , there was nothing either tender or lover - like . When I tried to share in a measure the action of movement prompted by her life , I became aware of a check , or of something strange in her that I can not explain , or an inner activity concealed in her nature . There is no suavity about the movements of women who have no soul in them . Our wills were opposed , and we did not keep step together . Words are wanting to describe this outward dissonance between two beings ; we are not accustomed to read a thought in a movement . We instinctively feel this phenomenon of our nature , but it can not be expressed .
53127	53141	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I did not dissect my sensations during those violent seizures of passion , "
53164	53234	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I did not analyze my pleasures nor count my heartbeats then , as a miser scrutinizes and weighs his gold pieces . No ; experience sheds its melancholy light over the events of the past to - day , and memory brings these pictures back , as the sea - waves in fair weather cast up fragment after fragment of the debris of a wrecked vessel upon the strand .
53235	53310	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' It is in your power to render me a rather important service , ' said the countess , looking at me in an embarrassed way . ' After confiding in you my aversion to lovers , I feel myself more at liberty to entreat your good offices in the name of friendship . Will there not be very much more merit in obliging me to - day ? ' she asked , laughing .
53311	53419	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I looked at her in anguish . Her manner was coaxing , but in no wise affectionate ; she felt nothing for me ; she seemed to be playing a part , and I thought her a consummate actress . Then all at once my hopes awoke once more , at a single look and word . Yet if reviving love expressed itself in my eyes , she bore its light without any change in the clearness of her own ; they seemed , like a tiger 's eyes , to have a sheet of metal behind them . I used to hate her in such moments .
53420	53518	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' The influence of the Duc de Navarreins would be very useful to me , with an all - powerful person in Russia , ' she went on , persuasion in every modulation of her voice , ' whose intervention I need in order to have justice done me in a matter that concerns both my fortune and my position in the world , that is to say , the recognition of my marriage by the Emperor . Is not the Duc de Navarreins a cousin of yours ? A letter from him would settle everything . '
53519	53533	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I am yours , ' I answered ; ' command me . '
53534	53571	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are very nice , ' she said , pressing my hand . ' Come and have dinner with me , and I will tell you everything , as if you were my confessor . '
53572	53601	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" So this discreet , suspicious woman , who had never been heard to speak a word about her affairs to any one , was going to consult me .
53602	53661	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Oh , how dear to me is this silence that you have imposed on me ! ' I cried ; ' but I would rather have had some sharper ordeal still . ' And she smiled upon the intoxication in my eyes ; she did not reject my admiration in any way ; surely she loved me !
53662	53846	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Fortunately , my purse held just enough to satisfy her cab - man . The day spent in her house , alone with her , was delicious ; it was the first time that I had seen her in this way . Hitherto we had always been kept apart by the presence of others , and by her formal politeness and reserved manners , even during her magnificent dinners ; but now it was as if I lived beneath her own roof -- I had her all to myself , so to speak . My wandering fancy broke down barriers , arranged the events of life to my liking , and steeped me in happiness and love . I seemed to myself her husband , I liked to watch her busied with little details ; it was a pleasure to me even to see her take off her bonnet and shawl . She left me alone for a little , and came back , charming , with her hair newly arranged ; and this dainty change of toilette had been made for me !
53847	53976	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" During the dinner she lavished attention upon me , and put charm without end into those numberless trifles to all seeming , that make up half of our existence nevertheless . As we sat together before a crackling fire , on silken cushions surrounded by the most desirable creations of Oriental luxury ; as I saw this woman whose famous beauty made every heart beat , so close to me ; an unapproachable woman who was talking and bringing all her powers of coquetry to bear upon me ; then my blissful pleasure rose almost to the point of suffering . To my vexation , I recollected the important business to be concluded ; I determined to go to keep the appointment made for me for this evening .
53977	53991	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' So soon ? ' she said , seeing me take my hat .
53992	54124	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She loved me , then ! or I thought so at least , from the bland tones in which those two words were uttered . I would then have bartered a couple of years of life for every hour she chose to grant to me , and so prolong my ecstasy . My happiness was increased by the extent of the money I sacrificed . It was midnight before she dismissed me . But on the morrow , for all that , my heroism cost me a good many remorseful pangs ; I was afraid the affair of the Memoirs , now of such importance for me , might have fallen through , and rushed off to Rastignac . We found the nominal author of my future labors just getting up .
54125	54317	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Finot read over a brief agreement to me , in which nothing whatever was said about my aunt , and when it had been signed he paid me down fifty crowns , and the three of us breakfasted together . I had only thirty francs left over , when I had paid for my new hat , for sixty tickets at thirty sous each , and settled my debts ; but for some days to come the difficulties of living were removed . If I had but listened to Rastignac , I might have had abundance by frankly adopting the ' English system . ' He really wanted to establish my credit by setting me to raise loans , on the theory that borrowing is the basis of credit . To hear him talk , the future was the largest and most secure kind of capital in the world . My future luck was hypothecated for the benefit of my creditors , and he gave my custom to his tailor , an artist , and a young man 's tailor , who was to leave me in peace until I married .
54318	54603	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The monastic life of study that I had led for three years past ended on this day . I frequented Foedora 's house very diligently , and tried to outshine the heroes or the swaggerers to be found in her circle . When I believed that I had left poverty for ever behind me , I regained my freedom of mind , humiliated my rivals , and was looked upon as a very attractive , dazzling , and irresistible sort of man . But acute folk used to say with regard to me , ' A fellow as clever as that will keep all his enthusiasms in his brain , ' and charitably extolled my faculties at the expense of my feelings . ' Is n't he lucky , not to be in love ! ' they exclaimed . ' If he were , could he be so light - hearted and animated ? ' Yet in Foedora 's presence I was as dull as love could make me . When I was alone with her , I had not a word to say , or if I did speak , I renounced love ; and I affected gaiety but ill , like a courtier who has a bitter mortification to hide . I tried in every way to make myself indispensable in her life , and necessary to her vanity and to her comfort ; I was a plaything at her pleasure , a slave always at her side . And when I had frittered away the day in this way , I went back to my work at night , securing merely two or three hours ' sleep in the early morning .
54604	54877	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" But I had not , like Rastignac , the ' English system ' at my finger - ends , and I very soon saw myself without a penny . I fell at once into that precarious way of life which industriously hides cold and miserable depths beneath an elusive surface of luxury ; I was a coxcomb without conquests , a penniless fop , a nameless gallant . The old sufferings were renewed , but less sharply ; no doubt I was growing used to the painful crisis . Very often my sole diet consisted of the scanty provision of cakes and tea that is offered in drawing - rooms , or one of the countess ' great dinners must sustain me for two whole days . I used all my time , and exerted every effort and all my powers of observation , to penetrate the impenetrable character of Foedora . Alternate hope and despair had swayed my opinions ; for me she was sometimes the tenderest , sometimes the most unfeeling of women . But these transitions from joy to sadness became unendurable ; I sought to end the horrible conflict within me by extinguishing love . By the light of warning gleams my soul sometimes recognized the gulfs that lay between us . The countess confirmed all my fears ; I had never yet detected any tear in her eyes ; an affecting scene in a play left her smiling and unmoved . All her instincts were selfish ; she could not divine another 's joy or sorrow . She had made a fool of me , in fact !
54878	55013	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I had rejoiced over a sacrifice to make for her , and almost humiliated myself in seeking out my kinsman , the Duc de Navarreins , a selfish man who was ashamed of my poverty , and had injured me too deeply not to hate me . He received me with the polite coldness that makes every word and gesture seem an insult ; he looked so ill at ease that I pitied him . I blushed for this pettiness amid grandeur , and penuriousness surrounded by luxury . He began to talk to me of his heavy losses in the three per cents , and then I told him the object of my visit . The change in his manners , hitherto glacial , which now gradually , became affectionate , disgusted me .
55014	55029	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Well , he called upon the countess , and completely eclipsed me with her .
55030	55155	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" On him Foedora exercised spells and witcheries unheard of ; she drew him into her power , and arranged her whole mysterious business with him ; I was left out , I heard not a word of it ; she had made a tool of me ! She did not seem to be aware of my existence while my cousin was present ; she received me less cordially perhaps than when I was first presented to her . One evening she chose to mortify me before the duke by a look , a gesture , that it is useless to try to express in words . I went away with tears in my eyes , planning terrible and outrageous schemes of vengeance without end .
55156	55303	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I often used to go with her to the theatre . Love utterly absorbed me as I sat beside her ; as I looked at her I used to give myself up to the pleasure of listening to the music , putting all my soul into the double joy of love and of hearing every emotion of my heart translated into musical cadences . It was my passion that filled the air and the stage , that was triumphant everywhere but with my mistress . Then I would take Foedora 's hand . I used to scan her features and her eyes , imploring of them some indication that one blended feeling possessed us both , seeking for the sudden harmony awakened by the power of music , which makes our souls vibrate in unison ; but her hand was passive , her eyes said nothing .
55304	55386	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" When the fire that burned in me glowed too fiercely from the face I turned upon her , she met it with that studied smile of hers , the conventional expression that sits on the lips of every portrait in every exhibition . She was not listening to the music . The divine pages of Rossini , Cimarosa , or Zingarelli called up no emotion , gave no voice to any poetry in her life ; her soul was a desert .
55387	55853	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Foedora presented herself as a drama before a drama . Her lorgnette traveled restlessly over the boxes ; she was restless too beneath the apparent calm ; fashion tyrannized over her ; her box , her bonnet , her carriage , her own personality absorbed her entirely . My merciless knowledge thoroughly tore away all my illusions . If good breeding consists in self - forgetfulness and consideration for others , in constantly showing gentleness in voice and bearing , in pleasing others , and in making them content in themselves , all traces of her plebeian origin were not yet obliterated in Foedora , in spite of her cleverness . Her self - forgetfulness was a sham , her manners were not innate but painfully acquired , her politeness was rather subservient . And yet for those she singled out , her honeyed words expressed natural kindness , her pretentious exaggeration was exalted enthusiasm . I alone had scrutinized her grimacings , and stripped away the thin rind that sufficed to conceal her real nature from the world ; her trickery no longer deceived me ; I had sounded the depths of that feline nature . I blushed for her when some donkey or other flattered and complimented her . And yet I loved her through it all ! I hoped that her snows would melt with the warmth of a poet 's love . If I could only have made her feel all the greatness that lies in devotion , then I should have seen her perfected , she would have been an angel . I loved her as a man , a lover , and an artist ; if it had been necessary not to love her so that I might win her , some cool - headed coxcomb , some self - possessed calculator would perhaps have had an advantage over me . She was so vain and sophisticated , that the language of vanity would appeal to her ; she would have allowed herself to be taken in the toils of an intrigue ; a hard , cold nature would have gained a complete ascendency over her . Keen grief had pierced me to my very soul , as she unconsciously revealed her absolute love of self . I seemed to see her as she one day would be , alone in the world , with no one to whom she could stretch her hand , with no friendly eyes for her own to meet and rest upon . I was bold enough to set this before her one evening ; I painted in vivid colors her lonely , sad , deserted old age . Her comment on this prospect of so terrible a revenge of thwarted nature was horrible .
55854	55887	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I shall always have money , ' she said ; ' and with money we can always inspire such sentiments as are necessary for our comfort in those about us . '
55888	56072	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I went away confounded by the arguments of luxury , by the reasoning of this woman of the world in which she lived ; and blamed myself for my infatuated idolatry . I myself had not loved Pauline because she was poor ; and had not the wealthy Foedora a right to repulse Raphael ? Conscience is our unerring judge until we finally stifle it . A specious voice said within me , ' Foedora is neither attracted to nor repulses any one ; she has her liberty , but once upon a time she sold herself to the Russian count , her husband or her lover , for gold . But temptation is certain to enter into her life . Wait till that moment comes ! ' She lived remote from humanity , in a sphere apart , in a hell or a heaven of her own ; she was neither frail nor virtuous . This feminine enigma in embroideries and cashmeres had brought into play every emotion of the human heart in me -- pride , ambition , love , curiosity .
56073	56209	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" There was a craze just then for praising a play at a little Boulevard theatre , prompted perhaps by a wish to appear original that besets us all , or due to some freak of fashion . The countess showed some signs of a wish to see the floured face of the actor who had so delighted several people of taste , and I obtained the honor of taking her to a first presentation of some wretched farce or other . A box scarcely cost five francs , but I had not a brass farthing . I was but half - way through the volume of Memoirs ; I dared not beg for assistance of Finot , and Rastignac , my providence , was away . These constant perplexities were the bane of my life .
56210	56397	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" We had once come out of the theatre when it was raining heavily , Foedora had called a cab for me before I could escape from her show of concern ; she would not admit any of my excuses -- my liking for wet weather , and my wish to go to the gaming - table . She did not read my poverty in my embarrassed attitude , or in my forced jests . My eyes would redden , but she did not understand a look . A young man 's life is at the mercy of the strangest whims ! At every revolution of the wheels during the journey , thoughts that burned stirred in my heart . I tried to pull up a plank from the bottom of the vehicle , hoping to slip through the hole into the street ; but finding insuperable obstacles , I burst into a fit of laughter , and then sat stupefied in calm dejection , like a man in a pillory . When I reached my lodging , Pauline broke in through my first stammering words with :
56398	56407	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' If you have n't any money---- ? '
56408	56432	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Ah , the music of Rossini was as nothing compared with those words . But to return to the performance at the Funambules .
56433	56530	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I thought of pawning the circlet of gold round my mother 's portrait in order to escort the countess . Although the pawnbroker loomed in my thoughts as one of the doors of a convict 's prison , I would rather myself have carried my bed thither than have begged for alms . There is something so painful in the expression of a man who asks money of you ! There are loans that mulct us of our self - respect , just as some rebuffs from a friend 's lips sweep away our last illusion .
56531	56583	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Pauline was working ; her mother had gone to bed . I flung a stealthy glance over the bed ; the curtains were drawn back a little ; Madame Gaudin was in a deep sleep , I thought , when I saw her quiet , sallow profile outlined against the pillow .
56584	56601	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are in trouble ? ' Pauline said , dipping her brush into the coloring .
56602	56623	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' It is in your power to do me a great service , my dear child , ' I answered .
56624	56632	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The gladness in her eyes frightened me .
56633	56711	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Is it possible that she loves me ? ' I thought . ' Pauline , ' I began . I went and sat near to her , so as to study her . My tones had been so searching that she read my thought ; her eyes fell , and I scrutinized her face . It was so pure and frank that I fancied I could see as clearly into her heart as into my own .
56712	56722	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Do you love me ? ' I asked .
56723	56735	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' A little,--passionately -- not a bit ! ' she cried .
56736	56787	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Then she did not love me . Her jesting tones , and a little gleeful movement that escaped her , expressed nothing beyond a girlish , blithe goodwill . I told her about my distress and the predicament in which I found myself , and asked her to help me .
56788	56817	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You do not wish to go to the pawnbroker 's yourself , M. Raphael , ' she answered , ' and yet you would send me ! '
56818	56852	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I blushed in confusion at the child 's reasoning . She took my hand in hers as if she wanted to compensate for this home - truth by her light touch upon it .
56853	56908	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Oh , I would willingly go , ' she said , ' but it is not necessary . I found two five - franc pieces at the back of the piano , that had slipped without your knowledge between the frame and the keyboard , and I laid them on your table . '
56909	56948	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You will soon be coming into some money , M. Raphael , ' said the kind mother , showing her face between the curtains , ' and I can easily lend you a few crowns meanwhile . '
56949	56974	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Oh , Pauline ! ' I cried , as I pressed her hand , ' how I wish that I were rich ! '
56975	57011	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Bah ! why should you ? ' she said petulantly . Her hand shook in mine with the throbbing of her pulse ; she snatched it away , and looked at both of mine .
57012	57053	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You will marry a rich wife , ' she said , ' but she will give you a great deal of trouble . Ah , _ Dieu _ ! she will be your death,--I am sure of it . '
57054	57069	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" In her exclamation there was something like belief in her mother 's absurd superstitions .
57070	57079	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are very credulous , Pauline ! '
57080	57110	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' The woman whom you will love is going to kill you -- there is no doubt of it , ' she said , looking at me with alarm .
57111	57173	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She took up her brush again and dipped it in the color ; her great agitation was evident ; she looked at me no longer . I was ready to give credence just then to superstitious fancies ; no man is utterly wretched so long as he is superstitious ; a belief of that kind is often in reality a hope .
57174	57256	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I found that those two magnificent five - franc pieces were lying , in fact , upon my table when I reached my room . During the first confused thoughts of early slumber , I tried to audit my accounts so as to explain this unhoped - for windfall ; but I lost myself in useless calculations , and slept . Just as I was leaving my room to engage a box the next morning , Pauline came to see me .
57257	57296	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Perhaps your ten francs is not enough , ' said the amiable , kind - hearted girl ; ' my mother told me to offer you this money . Take it , please , take it ! '
57297	57328	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She laid three crowns upon the table , and tried to escape , but I would not let her go . Admiration dried the tears that sprang to my eyes .
57329	57428	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are an angel , Pauline , ' I said . ' It is not the loan that touches me so much as the delicacy with which it is offered . I used to wish for a rich wife , a fashionable woman of rank ; and now , alas ! I would rather possess millions , and find some girl , as poor as you are , with a generous nature like your own ; and I would renounce a fatal passion which will kill me . Perhaps what you told me will come true . '
57429	57454	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' That is enough , ' she said , and fled away ; the fresh trills of her birdlike voice rang up the staircase .
57455	57484	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' She is very happy in not yet knowing love , ' I said to myself , thinking of the torments I had endured for many months past .
57485	57668	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Pauline 's fifteen francs were invaluable to me . Foedora , thinking of the stifling odor of the crowded place where we were to spend several hours , was sorry that she had not brought a bouquet ; I went in search of flowers for her , as I had laid already my life and my fate at her feet . With a pleasure in which compunction mingled , I gave her a bouquet . I learned from its price the extravagance of superficial gallantry in the world . But very soon she complained of the heavy scent of a Mexican jessamine . The interior of the theatre , the bare bench on which she was to sit , filled her with intolerable disgust ; she upbraided me for bringing her there . Although she sat beside me , she wished to go , and she went . I had spent sleepless nights , and squandered two months of my life for her , and I could not please her . Never had that tormenting spirit been more unfeeling or more fascinating .
57669	57779	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I sat beside her in the cramped back seat of the vehicle ; all the way I could feel her breath on me and the contact of her perfumed glove ; I saw distinctly all her exceeding beauty ; I inhaled a vague scent of orris - root ; so wholly a woman she was , with no touch of womanhood . Just then a sudden gleam of light lit up the depths of this mysterious life for me . I thought all at once of a book just published by a poet , a genuine conception of the artist , in the shape of the statue of Polycletus .
57780	57886	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I seemed to see that monstrous creation , at one time an officer , breaking in a spirited horse ; at another , a girl , who gives herself up to her toilette and breaks her lovers ' hearts ; or again , a false lover driving a timid and gentle maid to despair . Unable to analyze Foedora by any other process , I told her this fanciful story ; but no hint of her resemblance to this poetry of the impossible crossed her -- it simply diverted her ; she was like a child over a story from the _ Arabian Nights _ .
57887	57954	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Foedora must be shielded by some talisman , ' I thought to myself as I went back , ' or she could not resist the love of a man of my age , the infectious fever of that splendid malady of the soul . Is Foedora , like Lady Delacour , a prey to a cancer ? Her life is certainly an unnatural one . '
57955	58157	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I shuddered at the thought . Then I decided on a plan , at once the wildest and the most rational that lover ever dreamed of . I would study this woman from a physical point of view , as I had already studied her intellectually , and to this end I made up my mind to spend a night in her room without her knowledge . This project preyed upon me as a thirst for revenge gnaws at the heart of a Corsican monk . This is how I carried it out . On the days when Foedora received , her rooms were far too crowded for the hall - porter to keep the balance even between goers and comers ; I could remain in the house , I felt sure , without causing a scandal in it , and I waited the countess ' coming soiree with impatience . As I dressed I put a little English penknife into my waistcoat pocket , instead of a poniard . That literary implement , if found upon me , could awaken no suspicion , but I knew not whither my romantic resolution might lead , and I wished to be prepared .
58158	58243	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" As soon as the rooms began to fill , I entered the bedroom and examined the arrangements . The inner and outer shutters were closed ; this was a good beginning ; and as the waiting - maid might come to draw back the curtains that hung over the windows , I pulled them together . I was running great risks in venturing to manoeuvre beforehand in this way , but I had accepted the situation , and had deliberately reckoned with its dangers .
58244	58405	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" About midnight I hid myself in the embrasure of the window . I tried to scramble on to a ledge of the wainscoting , hanging on by the fastening of the shutters with my back against the wall , in such a position that my feet could not be visible . When I had carefully considered my points of support , and the space between me and the curtains , I had become sufficiently acquainted with all the difficulties of my position to stay in it without fear of detection if undisturbed by cramp , coughs , or sneezings . To avoid useless fatigue , I remained standing until the critical moment , when I must hang suspended like a spider in its web . The white - watered silk and muslin of the curtains spread before me in great pleats like organ - pipes . With my penknife I cut loopholes in them , through which I could see .
58406	58622	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I heard vague murmurs from the salons , the laughter and the louder tones of the speakers . The smothered commotion and vague uproar lessened by slow degrees . One man and another came for his hat from the countess ' chest of drawers , close to where I stood . I shivered , if the curtains were disturbed , at the thought of the mischances consequent on the confused and hasty investigations made by the men in a hurry to depart , who were rummaging everywhere . When I experienced no misfortunes of this kind , I augured well of my enterprise . An old wooer of Foedora 's came for the last hat ; he thought himself quite alone , looked at the bed , and heaved a great sigh , accompanied by some inaudible exclamation , into which he threw sufficient energy . In the boudoir close by , the countess , finding only some five or six intimate acquaintances about her , proposed tea . The scandals for which existing society has reserved the little faculty of belief that it retains , mingled with epigrams and trenchant witticisms , and the clatter of cups and spoons . Rastignac drew roars of laughter by merciless sarcasms at the expense of my rivals .
58623	58646	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' M. de Rastignac is a man with whom it is better not to quarrel , ' said the countess , laughing .
58647	58729	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I am quite of that opinion , ' was his candid reply . ' I have always been right about my aversions -- and my friendships as well , ' he added . ' Perhaps my enemies are quite as useful to me as my friends . I have made a particular study of modern phraseology , and of the natural craft that is used in all attack or defence . Official eloquence is one of our perfect social products .
58730	58942	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' One of your friends is not clever , so you speak of his integrity and his candor . Another 's work is heavy ; you introduce it as a piece of conscientious labor ; and if the book is ill written , you extol the ideas it contains . Such an one is treacherous and fickle , slips through your fingers every moment ; bah ! he is attractive , bewitching , he is delightful ! Suppose they are enemies , you fling every one , dead or alive , in their teeth . You reverse your phraseology for their benefit , and you are as keen in detecting their faults as you were before adroit in bringing out the virtues of your friends . This way of using the mental lorgnette is the secret of conversation nowadays , and the whole art of the complete courtier . If you neglect it , you might as well go out as an unarmed knight - banneret to fight against men in armor . And I make use of it , and even abuse it at times . So we are respected -- I and my friends ; and , moreover , my sword is quite as sharp as my tongue . '
58943	59030	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" One of Foedora 's most fervid worshipers , whose presumption was notorious , and who even made it contribute to his success , took up the glove thrown down so scornfully by Rastignac . He began an unmeasured eulogy of me , my performances , and my character . Rastignac had overlooked this method of detraction . His sarcastic encomiums misled the countess , who sacrificed without mercy ; she betrayed my secrets , and derided my pretensions and my hopes , to divert her friends .
59031	59086	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' There is a future before him , ' said Rastignac . ' Some day he may be in a position to take a cruel revenge ; his talents are at least equal to his courage ; and I should consider those who attack him very rash , for he has a good memory---- '
59087	59109	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' And writes Memoirs , ' put in the countess , who seemed to object to the deep silence that prevailed .
59110	59138	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Memoirs of a sham countess , madame , ' replied Rastignac . ' Another sort of courage is needed to write that sort of thing . '
59139	59161	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I give him credit for plenty of courage , ' she answered ; ' he is faithful to me . '
59162	59221	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I was greatly tempted to show myself suddenly among the railers , like the shade of Banquo in Macbeth . I should have lost a mistress , but I had a friend ! But love inspired me all at once , with one of those treacherous and fallacious subtleties that it can use to soothe all our pangs .
59222	59255	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" If Foedora loved me , I thought , she would be sure to disguise her feelings by some mocking jest . How often the heart protests against a lie on the lips !
59256	59274	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Well , very soon my audacious rival , left alone with the countess , rose to go .
59275	59325	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' What ! already ? ' asked she in a coaxing voice that set my heart beating . ' Will you not give me a few more minutes ? Have you nothing more to say to me ? will you never sacrifice any of your pleasures for me ? '
59326	59330	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" He went away .
59331	59347	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Ah ! ' she yawned ; ' how very tiresome they all are ! '
59348	59451	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She pulled a cord energetically till the sound of a bell rang through the place ; then , humming a few notes of _ Pria che spunti _ , the countess entered her room . No one had ever heard her sing ; her muteness had called forth the wildest explanations . She had promised her first lover , so it was said , who had been held captive by her talent , and whose jealousy over her stretched beyond his grave , that she would never allow others to experience a happiness that he wished to be his and his alone .
59452	59604	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I exerted every power of my soul to catch the sounds . Higher and higher rose the notes ; Foedora 's life seemed to dilate within her ; her throat poured forth all its richest tones ; something well - nigh divine entered into the melody . There was a bright purity and clearness of tone in the countess ' voice , a thrilling harmony which reached the heart and stirred its pulses . Musicians are seldom unemotional ; a woman who could sing like that must know how to love indeed . Her beautiful voice made one more puzzle in a woman mysterious enough before . I beheld her then , as plainly as I see you at this moment . She seemed to listen to herself , to experience a secret rapture of her own ; she felt , as it were , an ecstasy like that of love .
59605	59686	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She stood before the hearth during the execution of the principal theme of the _ rondo _ ; and when she ceased her face changed . She looked tired ; her features seemed to alter . She had laid the mask aside ; her part as an actress was over . Yet the faded look that came over her beautiful face , a result either of this performance or of the evening 's fatigues , had its charms , too .
59687	59698	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' This is her real self , ' I thought .
59699	59883	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She set her foot on a bronze bar of the fender as if to warm it , took off her gloves , and drew over her head the gold chain from which her bejeweled scent - bottle hung . It gave me a quite indescribable pleasure to watch the feline grace of every movement ; the supple grace a cat displays as it adjusts its toilette in the sun . She looked at herself in the mirror and said aloud ill - humoredly--'I did not look well this evening , my complexion is going with alarming rapidity ; perhaps I ought to keep earlier hours , and give up this life of dissipation . Does Justine mean to trifle with me ? ' She rang again ; her maid hurried in . Where she had been I can not tell ; she came in by a secret staircase . I was anxious to make a study of her . I had lodged accusations , in my romantic imaginings , against this invisible waiting - woman , a tall , well - made brunette .
59884	59890	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Did madame ring ? '
59891	59909	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Yes , twice , ' answered Foedora ; ' are you really growing deaf nowadays ? '
59910	59921	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I was preparing madame 's milk of almonds . '
59922	59981	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Justine knelt down before her , unlaced her sandals and drew them off , while her mistress lay carelessly back on her cushioned armchair beside the fire , yawned , and scratched her head . Every movement was perfectly natural ; there was nothing whatever to indicate the secret sufferings or emotions with which I had credited her .
59982	60017	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' George must be in love ! ' she remarked . ' I shall dismiss him . He has drawn the curtains again to - night . What does he mean by it ? '
60018	60040	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" All the blood in my veins rushed to my heart at this observation , but no more was said about curtains .
60041	60118	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Life is very empty , ' the countess went on . ' Ah ! be careful not to scratch me as you did yesterday . Just look here , I still have the marks of your nails about me , ' and she held out a silken knee . She thrust her bare feet into velvet slippers bound with swan's - down , and unfastened her dress , while Justine prepared to comb her hair .
60119	60132	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You ought to marry , madame , and have children . '
60133	60176	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Children ! ' she cried ; ' it wants no more than that to finish me at once ; and a husband ! What man is there to whom I could---- ? Was my hair well arranged to - night ? '
60177	60182	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Not particularly . '
60183	60190	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are a fool ! '
60191	60221	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' That way of crimping your hair too much is the least becoming way possible for you . Large , smooth curls suit you a great deal better . '
60222	60226	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Really ? '
60227	60245	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Yes , really , madame ; that wavy style only looks nice in fair hair . '
60246	60267	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Marriage ? never , never ! Marriage is a commercial arrangement , for which I was never made . '
60268	60343	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" What a disheartening scene for a lover ! Here was a lonely woman , without friends or kin , without the religion of love , without faith in any affection . Yet however slightly she might feel the need to pour out her heart , a craving that every human being feels , it could only be satisfied by gossiping with her maid , by trivial and indifferent talk .... I grieved for her .
60344	60418	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Justine unlaced her . I watched her carefully when she was at last unveiled . Her maidenly form , in its rose - tinged whiteness , was visible through her shift in the taper light , as dazzling as some silver statue behind its gauze covering . No , there was no defect that need shrink from the stolen glances of love . Alas , a fair form will overcome the stoutest resolutions !
60419	60579	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The maid lighted the taper in the alabaster sconce that hung before the bed , while her mistress sat thoughtful and silent before the fire . Justine went for a warming - pan , turned down the bed , and helped to lay her mistress in it ; then , after some further time spent in punctiliously rendering various services that showed how seriously Foedora respected herself , her maid left her . The countess turned to and fro several times , and sighed ; she was ill at ease ; faint , just perceptible sounds , like sighs of impatience , escaped from her lips . She reached out a hand to the table , and took a flask from it , from which she shook four or five drops of some brown liquid into some milk before taking it ; again there followed some painful sighs , and the exclamation , ' _ Mon Dieu _ ! '
60580	60704	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The cry , and the tone in which it was uttered , wrung my heart . By degrees she lay motionless . This frightened me ; but very soon I heard a sleeper 's heavy , regular breathing . I drew the rustling silk curtains apart , left my post , went to the foot of the bed , and gazed at her with feelings that I can not define . She was so enchanting as she lay like a child , with her arm above her head ; but the sweetness of the fair , quiet visage , surrounded by the lace , only irritated me . I had not been prepared for the torture to which I was compelled to submit .
60705	60812	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' _ Mon Dieu _ ! ' that scrap of a thought which I understood not , but must even take as my sole light , had suddenly modified my opinion of Foedora . Trite or profoundly significant , frivolous or of deep import , the words might be construed as expressive of either pleasure or pain , of physical or of mental suffering . Was it a prayer or a malediction , a forecast or a memory , a fear or a regret ? A whole life lay in that utterance , a life of wealth or of penury ; perhaps it contained a crime !
60813	60968	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The mystery that lurked beneath this fair semblance of womanhood grew afresh ; there were so many ways of explaining Foedora , that she became inexplicable . A sort of language seemed to flow from between her lips . I put thoughts and feelings into the accidents of her breathing , whether weak or regular , gentle , or labored . I shared her dreams ; I would fain have divined her secrets by reading them through her slumber . I hesitated among contradictory opinions and decisions without number . I could not deny my heart to the woman I saw before me , with the calm , pure beauty in her face . I resolved to make one more effort . If I told her the story of my life , my love , my sacrifices , might I not awaken pity in her or draw a tear from her who never wept ?
60969	61107	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" As I set all my hopes on this last experiment , the sounds in the streets showed that day was at hand . For a moment 's space I pictured Foedora waking to find herself in my arms . I could have stolen softly to her side and slipped them about her in a close embrace . Resolved to resist the cruel tyranny of this thought , I hurried into the salon , heedless of any sounds I might make ; but , luckily , I came upon a secret door leading to a little staircase . As I expected , the key was in the lock ; I slammed the door , went boldly out into the court , and gained the street in three bounds , without looking round to see whether I was observed .
61108	61201	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" A dramatist was to read a comedy at the countess ' house in two days ' time ; I went thither , intending to outstay the others , so as to make a rather singular request to her ; I meant to ask her to keep the following evening for me alone , and to deny herself to other comers ; but when I found myself alone with her , my courage failed . Every tick of the clock alarmed me . It wanted only a quarter of an hour of midnight .
61202	61229	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' If I do not speak , ' I thought to myself , ' I must smash my head against the corner of the mantelpiece . '
61230	61266	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I gave myself three minutes ' grace ; the three minutes went by , and I did not smash my head upon the marble ; my heart grew heavy , like a sponge with water .
61267	61277	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are exceedingly amusing , ' said she .
61278	61294	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Ah , madame , if you could but understand me ! ' I answered .
61295	61314	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' What is the matter with you ? ' she asked . ' You are turning pale . '
61315	61327	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I am hesitating to ask a favor of you . '
61328	61344	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Her gesture revived my courage . I asked her to make the appointment with me .
61345	61364	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Willingly , ' she answered ' ' but why will you not speak to me now ? '
61365	61497	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' To be candid with you , I ought to explain the full scope of your promise : I want to spend this evening by your side , as if we were brother and sister . Have no fear ; I am aware of your antipathies ; you must have divined me sufficiently to feel sure that I should wish you to do nothing that could be displeasing to you ; presumption , moreover , would not thus approach you . You have been a friend to me , you have shown me kindness and great indulgence ; know , therefore , that to - morrow I must bid you farewell.--Do not take back your word , ' I exclaimed , seeing her about to speak , and I went away .
61498	61566	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" At eight o'clock one evening towards the end of May , Foedora and I were alone together in her gothic boudoir . I feared no longer ; I was secure of happiness . My mistress should be mine , or I would seek a refuge in death . I had condemned my faint - hearted love , and a man who acknowledges his weakness is strong indeed .
61567	61668	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The countess , in her blue cashmere gown , was reclining on a sofa , with her feet on a cushion . She wore an Oriental turban such as painters assign to early Hebrews ; its strangeness added an indescribable coquettish grace to her attractions . A transitory charm seemed to have laid its spell on her face ; it might have furnished the argument that at every instant we become new and unparalleled beings , without any resemblance to the _ us _ of the future or of the past . I had never yet seen her so radiant .
61669	61686	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Do you know that you have piqued my curiosity ? ' she said , laughing .
61687	61725	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I will not disappoint it , ' I said quietly , as I seated myself near to her and took the hand that she surrendered to me . ' You have a very beautiful voice ! '
61726	61743	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You have never heard me sing ! ' she exclaimed , starting involuntarily with surprise .
61744	61782	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I will prove that it is quite otherwise , whenever it is necessary . Is your delightful singing still to remain a mystery ? Have no fear , I do not wish to penetrate it . '
61783	61872	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" We spent about an hour in familiar talk . While I adopted the attitude and manner of a man to whom Foedora must refuse nothing , I showed her all a lover 's deference . Acting in this way , I received a favor -- I was allowed to kiss her hand . She daintily drew off the glove , and my whole soul was dissolved and poured forth in that kiss . I was steeped in the bliss of an illusion in which I tried to believe .
61873	62058	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Foedora lent herself most unexpectedly to my caress and my flatteries . Do not accuse me of faint - heartedness ; if I had gone a step beyond these fraternal compliments , the claws would have been out of the sheath and into me . We remained perfectly silent for nearly ten minutes . I was admiring her , investing her with the charms she had not . She was mine just then , and mine only,--this enchanting being was mine , as was permissible , in my imagination ; my longing wrapped her round and held her close ; in my soul I wedded her . The countess was subdued and fascinated by my magnetic influence . Ever since I have regretted that this subjugation was not absolute ; but just then I yearned for her soul , her heart alone , and for nothing else . I longed for an ideal and perfect happiness , a fair illusion that can not last for very long . At last I spoke , feeling that the last hours of my frenzy were at hand .
62059	62439	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Hear me , madame . I love you , and you know it ; I have said so a hundred times ; you must have understood me . I would not take upon me the airs of a coxcomb , nor would I flatter you , nor urge myself upon you like a fool ; I would not owe your love to such arts as these ! so I have been misunderstood . What sufferings have I not endured for your sake ! For these , however , you were not to blame ; but in a few minutes you shall decide for yourself . There are two kinds of poverty , madame . One kind openly walks the street in rags , an unconscious imitator of Diogenes , on a scanty diet , reducing life to its simplest terms ; he is happier , maybe , than the rich ; he has fewer cares at any rate , and accepts such portions of the world as stronger spirits refuse . Then there is poverty in splendor , a Spanish pauper , concealing the life of a beggar by his title , his bravery , and his pride ; poverty that wears a white waistcoat and yellow kid gloves , a beggar with a carriage , whose whole career will be wrecked for lack of a halfpenny . Poverty of the first kind belongs to the populace ; the second kind is that of blacklegs , of kings , and of men of talent . I am neither a man of the people , nor a king , nor a swindler ; possibly I have no talent either , I am an exception . With the name I bear I must die sooner than beg . Set your mind at rest , madame , ' I said ; ' to - day I have abundance , I possess sufficient of the clay for my needs ' ; for the hard look passed over her face which we wear whenever a well - dressed beggar takes us by surprise . ' Do you remember the day when you wished to go to the Gymnase without me , never believing that I should be there ? ' I went on .
62440	62443	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She nodded .
62444	62482	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I had laid out my last five - franc piece that I might see you there.--Do you recollect our walk in the Jardin des Plantes ? The hire of your cab took everything I had . '
62483	62659	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I told her about my sacrifices , and described the life I led ; heated not with wine , as I am to - day , but by the generous enthusiasm of my heart , my passion overflowed in burning words ; I have forgotten how the feelings within me blazed forth ; neither memory nor skill of mine could possibly reproduce it . It was no colorless chronicle of blighted affections ; my love was strengthened by fair hopes ; and such words came to me , by love 's inspiration , that each had power to set forth a whole life -- like echoes of the cries of a soul in torment . In such tones the last prayers ascend from dying men on the battlefield . I stopped , for she was weeping . _ Grand Dieu _ ! I had reaped an actor 's reward , the success of a counterfeit passion displayed at the cost of five francs paid at the theatre door . I had drawn tears from her .
62660	62669	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' If I had known---- ' she said .
62670	62694	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Do not finish the sentence , ' I broke in . ' Even now I love you well enough to murder you---- '
62695	62711	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" She reached for the bell - pull . I burst into a roar of laughter .
62712	62771	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Do not call any one , ' I said . ' I shall leave you to finish your life in peace . It would be a blundering kind of hatred that would murder you ! You need not fear violence of any kind ; I have spent a whole night at the foot of your bed without---- '
62772	62808	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Monsieur---- ' she said , blushing ; but after that first impulse of modesty that even the most hardened women must surely own , she flung a scornful glance at me , and said :
62809	62818	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You must have been very cold . '
62819	62961	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Do you think that I set such value on your beauty , madame , ' I answered , guessing the thoughts that moved her . ' Your beautiful face is for me a promise of a soul yet more beautiful . Madame , those to whom a woman is merely a woman can always purchase odalisques fit for the seraglio , and achieve their happiness at a small cost . But I aspired to something higher ; I wanted the life of close communion of heart and heart with you that have no heart . I know that now . If you were to belong to another , I could kill him . And yet , no ; for you would love him , and his death might hurt you perhaps . What agony this is ! ' I cried .
62962	62990	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' If it is any comfort to you , ' she retorted cheerfully , ' I can assure you that I shall never belong to any one---- '
62991	63117	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' So you offer an affront to God Himself , ' I interrupted ; ' and you will be punished for it . Some day you will lie upon your sofa suffering unheard - of ills , unable to endure the light or the slightest sound , condemned to live as it were in the tomb . Then , when you seek the causes of those lingering and avenging torments , you will remember the woes that you distributed so lavishly upon your way . You have sown curses , and hatred will be your reward . We are the real judges , the executioners of a justice that reigns here below , which overrules the justice of man and the laws of God . '
63118	63305	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' No doubt it is very culpable in me not to love you , ' she said , laughing . ' Am I to blame ? No . I do not love you ; you are a man , that is sufficient . I am happy by myself ; why should I give up my way of living , a selfish way , if you will , for the caprices of a master ? Marriage is a sacrament by virtue of which each imparts nothing but vexations to the other . Children , moreover , worry me . Did I not faithfully warn you about my nature ? Why are you not satisfied to have my friendship ? I wish I could make you amends for all the troubles I have caused you , through not guessing the value of your poor five - franc pieces . I appreciate the extent of your sacrifices ; but your devotion and delicate tact can be repaid by love alone , and I care so little for you , that this scene has a disagreeable effect upon me . '
63306	63372	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I am fully aware of my absurdity , ' I said , unable to restrain my tears . ' Pardon me , ' I went on , ' it was a delight to hear those cruel words you have just uttered , so well I love you . O , if I could testify my love with every drop of blood in me ! '
63373	63430	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Men always repeat these classic formulas to us , more or less effectively , ' she answered , still smiling . ' But it appears very difficult to die at our feet , for I see corpses of that kind about everywhere . It is twelve o'clock . Allow me to go to bed . '
63431	63452	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' And in two hours ' time you will cry to yourself , _ Ah , mon Dieu _ ! '
63453	63502	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Like the day before yesterday ! Yes , ' she said , ' I was thinking of my stockbroker ; I had forgotten to tell him to convert my five per cent stock into threes , and the three per cents had fallen during the day . '
63503	63557	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I looked at her , and my eyes glittered with anger . Sometimes a crime may be a whole romance ; I understood that just then . She was so accustomed , no doubt , to the most impassioned declarations of this kind , that my words and my tears were forgotten already .
63558	63572	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Would you marry a peer of France ? ' I demanded abruptly .
63573	63584	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' If he were a duke , I might . '
63585	63595	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I seized my hat and made her a bow .
63596	63628	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Permit me to accompany you to the door , ' she said , cutting irony in her tones , in the poise of her head , and in her gesture .
63629	63632	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Madame---- '
63633	63637	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Monsieur ? '
63638	63647	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I shall never see you again . '
63648	63661	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I hope not , ' and she insolently inclined her head .
63662	63761	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You wish to be a duchess ? ' I cried , excited by a sort of madness that her insolence roused in me . ' You are wild for honors and titles ? Well , only let me love you ; bid my pen write and my voice speak for you alone ; be the inmost soul of my life , my guiding star ! Then , only accept me for your husband as a minister , a peer of France , a duke . I will make of myself whatever you would have me be ! '
63762	63791	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You made good use of the time you spent with the advocate , ' she said smiling . ' There is a fervency about your pleadings . '
63792	63852	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' The present is yours , ' I cried , ' but the future is mine ! I only lose a woman ; you are losing a name and a family . Time is big with my revenge ; time will spoil your beauty , and yours will be a solitary death ; and glory waits for me ! '
63853	63883	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Thanks for your peroration ! ' she said , repressing a yawn ; the wish that she might never see me again was expressed in her whole bearing .
63884	63903	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" That remark silenced me . I flung at her a glance full of hatred , and hurried away .
63904	64071	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Foedora must be forgotten ; I must cure myself of my infatuation , and betake myself once more to my lonely studies , or die . So I set myself tremendous tasks ; I determined to complete my labors . For fifteen days I never left my garret , spending whole nights in pallid thought . I worked with difficulty , and by fits and starts , despite my courage and the stimulation of despair . The music had fled . I could not exorcise the brilliant mocking image of Foedora . Something morbid brooded over every thought , a vague longing as dreadful as remorse . I imitated the anchorites of the Thebaid . If I did not pray as they did , I lived a life in the desert like theirs , hewing out my ideas as they were wo nt to hew their rocks . I could at need have girdled my waist with spikes , that physical suffering might quell mental anguish .
64072	64082	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" One evening Pauline found her way into my room .
64083	64104	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are killing yourself , ' she said imploringly ; ' you should go out and see your friends---- '
64105	64130	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Pauline , you were a true prophet ; Foedora is killing me , I want to die . My life is intolerable . '
64131	64160	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Is there only one woman in the world ? ' she asked , smiling . ' Why make yourself so miserable in so short a life ? '
64161	64266	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I looked at Pauline in bewilderment . She left me before I noticed her departure ; the sound of her words had reached me , but not their sense . Very soon I had to take my Memoirs in manuscript to my literary - contractor . I was so absorbed by my passion , that I could not remember how I had managed to live without money ; I only knew that the four hundred and fifty francs due to me would pay my debts . So I went to receive my salary , and met Rastignac , who thought me changed and thinner .
64267	64280	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' What hospital have you been discharged from ? ' he asked .
64281	64303	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' That woman is killing me , ' I answered ; ' I can neither despise her nor forget her . '
64304	64328	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You had much better kill her , then perhaps you would think no more of her , ' he said , laughing .
64329	64394	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I have often thought of it , ' I replied ; ' but though sometimes the thought of a crime revives my spirits , of violence and murder , either or both , I am really incapable of carrying out the design . The countess is an admirable monster who would crave for pardon , and not every man is an Othello . '
64395	64411	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' She is like every woman who is beyond our reach , ' Rastignac interrupted .
64412	64512	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I am mad , ' I cried ; ' I can feel the madness raging at times in my brain . My ideas are like shadows ; they flit before me , and I can not grasp them . Death would be preferable to this life , and I have carefully considered the best way of putting an end to the struggle . I am not thinking of the living Foedora in the Faubourg Saint Honore , but of my Foedora here , ' and I tapped my forehead . ' What to you say to opium ? '
64513	64523	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Pshaw ! horrid agonies , ' said Rastignac .
64524	64530	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Or charcoal fumes ? '
64531	64537	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' A low dodge . '
64538	64544	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Or the Seine ? '
64545	64560	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' The drag - nets , and the Morgue too , are filthy . '
64561	64568	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' A pistol - shot ? '
64569	64819	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' And if you miscalculate , you disfigure yourself for life . Listen to me , ' he went on , ' like all young men , I have pondered over suicide . Which of us has n't killed himself two or three times before he is thirty ? I find there is no better course than to use existence as a means of pleasure . Go in for thorough dissipation , and your passion or you will perish in it . Intemperance , my dear fellow , commands all forms of death . Does she not wield the thunderbolt of apoplexy ? Apoplexy is a pistol - shot that does not miscalculate . Orgies are lavish in all physical pleasures ; is not that the small change for opium ? And the riot that makes us drink to excess bears a challenge to mortal combat with wine . That butt of Malmsey of the Duke of Clarence 's must have had a pleasanter flavor than Seine mud . When we sink gloriously under the table , is not that a periodical death by drowning on a small scale ? If we are picked up by the police and stretched out on those chilly benches of theirs at the police - station , do we not enjoy all the pleasures of the Morgue ? For though we are not blue and green , muddy and swollen corpses , on the other hand we have the consciousness of the climax .
64820	64999	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Ah , ' he went on , ' this protracted suicide has nothing in common with the bankrupt grocer 's demise . Tradespeople have brought the river into disrepute ; they fling themselves in to soften their creditors ' hearts . In your place I should endeavor to die gracefully ; and if you wish to invent a novel way of doing it , by struggling with life after this manner , I will be your second . I am disappointed and sick of everything . The Alsacienne , whom it was proposed that I should marry , had six toes on her left foot ; I can not possibly live with a woman who has six toes ! It would get about to a certainty , and then I should be ridiculous . Her income was only eighteen thousand francs ; her fortune diminished in quantity as her toes increased . The devil take it ; if we begin an outrageous sort of life , we may come on some bit of luck , perhaps ! '
65000	65031	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Rastignac 's eloquence carried me away . The attractions of the plan shone too temptingly , hopes were kindled , the poetical aspects of the matter appealed to a poet .
65032	65041	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' How about money ? ' I said .
65042	65053	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Have n't you four hundred and fifty francs ? '
65054	65066	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Yes , but debts to my landlady and the tailor---- '
65067	65089	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You would pay your tailor ? You will never be anything whatever , not so much as a minister . '
65090	65101	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' But what can one do with twenty louis ? '
65102	65111	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Go to the gaming - table . '
65112	65115	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I shuddered .
65116	65152	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' You are going to launch out into what I call systematic dissipation , ' said he , noticing my scruples , ' and yet you are afraid of a green table - cloth . '
65153	65237	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Listen to me , ' I answered . ' I promised my father never to set foot in a gaming - house . Not only is that a sacred promise , but I still feel an unconquerable disgust whenever I pass a gambling - hell ; take the money and go without me . While our fortune is at stake , I will set my own affairs straight , and then I will go to your lodgings and wait for you . '
65238	65367	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" That was the way I went to perdition . A young man has only to come across a woman who will not love him , or a woman who loves him too well , and his whole life becomes a chaos . Prosperity swallows up our energy just as adversity obscures our virtues . Back once more in my Hotel de Saint - Quentin , I gazed about me a long while in the garret where I had led my scholar 's temperate life , a life which would perhaps have been a long and honorable one , and that I ought not to have quitted for the fevered existence which had urged me to the brink of a precipice . Pauline surprised me in this dejected attitude .
65368	65382	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Why , what is the matter with you ? ' she asked .
65383	65418	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I rose and quietly counted out the money owing to her mother , and added to it sufficient to pay for six months ' rent in advance . She watched me in some alarm .
65419	65431	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I am going to leave you , dear Pauline . '
65432	65441	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I knew it ! ' she exclaimed .
65442	65503	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Listen , my child . I have not given up the idea of coming back . Keep my room for me for six months . If I do not return by the fifteenth of November , you will come into possession of my things . This sealed packet of manuscript is the fair copy of my great work on "
65507	65543	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I went on , pointing to a package . ' Will you deposit it in the King 's Library ? And you may do as you wish with everything that is left here . '
65544	65562	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Her look weighed heavily on my heart ; Pauline was an embodiment of conscience there before me .
65563	65580	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I shall have no more lessons , ' she said , pointing to the piano .
65581	65587	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I did not answer that .
65588	65596	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Will you write to me ? '
65597	65605	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Good - bye , Pauline . '
65606	65687	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I gently drew her towards me , and set a kiss on that innocent fair brow of hers , like snow that has not yet touched the earth -- a father 's or a brother 's kiss . She fled . I would not see Madame Gaudin , hung my key in its wonted place , and departed . I was almost at the end of the Rue de Cluny when I heard a woman 's light footstep behind me .
65688	65709	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' I have embroidered this purse for you , ' Pauline said ; ' will you refuse even that ? '
65710	65752	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" By the light of the street lamp I thought I saw tears in Pauline 's eyes , and I groaned . Moved perhaps by a common impulse , we parted in haste like people who fear the contagion of the plague .
65753	65947	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" As I waited with dignified calmness for Rastignac 's return , his room seemed a grotesque interpretation of the sort of life I was about to enter upon . The clock on the chimney - piece was surmounted by a Venus resting on her tortoise ; a half - smoked cigar lay in her arms . Costly furniture of various kinds -- love tokens , very likely -- was scattered about . Old shoes lay on a luxurious sofa . The comfortable armchair into which I had thrown myself bore as many scars as a veteran ; the arms were gnashed , the back was overlaid with a thick , stale deposit of pomade and hair - oil from the heads of all his visitors . Splendor and squalor were oddly mingled , on the walls , the bed , and everywhere . You might have thought of a Neapolitan palace and the groups of lazzaroni about it . It was the room of a gambler or a mauvais sujet , where the luxury exists for one individual , who leads the life of the senses and does not trouble himself over inconsistencies .
65948	66173	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" There was a certain imaginative element about the picture it presented . Life was suddenly revealed there in its rags and spangles as the incomplete thing it really is , of course , but so vividly and picturesquely ; it was like a den where a brigand has heaped up all the plunder in which he delights . Some pages were missing from a copy of Byron 's poems : they had gone to light a fire of a few sticks for this young person , who played for stakes of a thousand francs , and had not a faggot ; he kept a tilbury , and had not a whole shirt to his back . Any day a countess or an actress or a run of luck at ecarte might set him up with an outfit worthy of a king . A candle had been stuck into the green bronze sheath of a vestaholder ; a woman 's portrait lay yonder , torn out of its carved gold setting . How was it possible that a young man , whose nature craved excitement , could renounce a life so attractive by reason of its contradictions ; a life that afforded all the delights of war in the midst of peace ? I was growing drowsy when Rastignac kicked the door open and shouted :
66174	66187	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Victory ! Now we can take our time about dying . '
66188	66260	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" He held out his hat filled with gold to me , and put it down on the table ; then we pranced round it like a pair of cannibals about to eat a victim ; we stamped , and danced , and yelled , and sang ; we gave each other blows fit to kill an elephant , at sight of all the pleasures of the world contained in that hat .
66261	66327	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' Twenty - seven thousand francs , ' said Rastignac , adding a few bank - notes to the pile of gold . ' That would be enough for other folk to live upon ; will it be sufficient for us to die on ? Yes ! we will breathe our last in a bath of gold -- hurrah ! ' and we capered afresh .
66328	66373	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" We divided the windfall . We began with double - napoleons , and came down to the smaller coins , one by one . ' This for you , this for me , ' we kept saying , distilling our joy drop by drop .
66374	66393	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' We wo n't go to sleep , ' cried Rastignac . ' Joseph ! some punch ! '
66394	66402	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" He threw gold to his faithful attendant .
66403	66423	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" ' There is your share , ' he said ; ' go and bury yourself if you can . '
66424	66562	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Next day I went to Lesage and chose my furniture , took the rooms that you know in the Rue Taitbout , and left the decoration to one of the best upholsterers . I bought horses . I plunged into a vortex of pleasures , at once hollow and real . I went in for play , gaining and losing enormous sums , but only at friends ' houses and in ballrooms ; never in gaming - houses , for which I still retained the holy horror of my early days . Without meaning it , I made some friends , either through quarrels or owing to the easy confidence established among those who are going to the bad together ; nothing , possibly , makes us cling to one another so tightly as our evil propensities .
66563	66613	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I made several ventures in literature , which were flatteringly received . Great men who followed the profession of letters , having nothing to fear from me , belauded me , not so much on account of my merits as to cast a slur on those of their rivals .
66614	66713	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I became a ' free - liver , ' to make use of the picturesque expression appropriated by the language of excess . I made it a point of honor not to be long about dying , and that my zeal and prowess should eclipse those displayed by all others in the jolliest company . I was always spruce and carefully dressed . I had some reputation for cleverness . There was no sign about me of the fearful way of living which makes a man into a mere disgusting apparatus , a funnel , a pampered beast .
66714	66805	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Very soon Debauch rose before me in all the majesty of its horror , and I grasped all that it meant . Those prudent , steady - going characters who are laying down wine in bottles for their heirs , can barely conceive , it is true , of so wide a theory of life , nor appreciate its normal condition ; but when will you instill poetry into the provincial intellect ? Opium and tea , with all their delights , are merely drugs to folk of that calibre .
66806	66896	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Is not the imperfect sybarite to be met with even in Paris itself , that intellectual metropolis ? Unfit to endure the fatigues of pleasure , this sort of person , after a drinking bout , is very much like those worthy bourgeois who fall foul of music after hearing a new opera by Rossini . Does he not renounce these courses in the same frame of mind that leads an abstemious man to forswear Ruffec pates , because the first one , forsooth , gave him the indigestion ?
66897	67095	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Debauch is as surely an art as poetry , and is not for craven spirits . To penetrate its mysteries and appreciate its charms , conscientious application is required ; and as with every path of knowledge , the way is thorny and forbidding at the outset . The great pleasures of humanity are hedged about with formidable obstacles ; not its single enjoyments , but enjoyment as a system , a system which establishes seldom experienced sensations and makes them habitual , which concentrates and multiplies them for us , creating a dramatic life within our life , and imperatively demanding a prompt and enormous expenditure of vitality . War , Power , Art , like Debauch , are all forms of demoralization , equally remote from the faculties of humanity , equally profound , and all are alike difficult of access . But when man has once stormed the heights of these grand mysteries , does he not walk in another world ? Are not generals , ministers , and artists carried , more or less , towards destruction by the need of violent distractions in an existence so remote from ordinary life as theirs ?
67096	67201	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" War , after all , is the Excess of bloodshed , as the Excess of self - interest produces Politics . Excesses of every sort are brothers . These social enormities possess the attraction of the abyss ; they draw towards themselves as St. Helena beckoned Napoleon ; we are fascinated , our heads swim , we wish to sound their depths though we can not account for the wish . Perhaps the thought of Infinity dwells in these precipices , perhaps they contain some colossal flattery for the soul of man ; for is he not , then , wholly absorbed in himself ?
67202	67292	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The wearied artist needs a complete contrast to his paradise of imaginings and of studious hours ; he either craves , like God , the seventh day of rest , or with Satan , the pleasures of hell ; so that his senses may have free play in opposition to the employment of his faculties . Byron could never have taken for his relaxation to the independent gentleman 's delights of boston and gossip , for he was a poet , and so must needs pit Greece against Mahmoud .
67293	67428	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" In war , is not man an angel of extirpation , a sort of executioner on a gigantic scale ? Must not the spell be strong indeed that makes us undergo such horrid sufferings so hostile to our weak frames , sufferings that encircle every strong passion with a hedge of thorns ? The tobacco smoker is seized with convulsions , and goes through a kind of agony consequent upon his excesses ; but has he not borne a part in delightful festivals in realms unknown ? Has Europe ever ceased from wars ? She has never given herself time to wipe the stains from her feet that are steeped in blood to the ankle . Mankind at large is carried away by fits of intoxication , as nature has its accessions of love .
67429	67503	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" For men in private life , for a vegetating Mirabeau dreaming of storms in a time of calm , Excess comprises all things ; it perpetually embraces the whole sum of life ; it is something better still -- it is a duel with an antagonist of unknown power , a monster , terrible at first sight , that must be seized by the horns , a labor that can not be imagined .
67504	67582	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Suppose that nature has endowed you with a feeble stomach or one of limited capacity ; you acquire a mastery over it and improve it ; you learn to carry your liquor ; you grow accustomed to being drunk ; you pass whole nights without sleep ; at last you acquire the constitution of a colonel of cuirassiers ; and in this way you create yourself afresh , as if to fly in the face of Providence .
67583	67680	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" A man transformed after this sort is like a neophyte who has at last become a veteran , has accustomed his mind to shot and shell and his legs to lengthy marches . When the monster 's hold on him is still uncertain , and it is not yet known which will have the better of it , they roll over and over , alternately victor and vanquished , in a world where everything is wonderful , where every ache of the soul is laid to sleep , where only the shadows of ideas are revived .
67681	67767	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" This furious struggle has already become a necessity for us . The prodigal has struck a bargain for all the enjoyments with which life teems abundantly , at the price of his own death , like the mythical persons in legends who sold themselves to the devil for the power of doing evil . For them , instead of flowing quietly on in its monotonous course in the depths of some counting - house or study , life is poured out in a boiling torrent .
67768	67914	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Excess is , in short , for the body what the mystic 's ecstasy is for the soul . Intoxication steeps you in fantastic imaginings every whit as strange as those of ecstatics . You know hours as full of rapture as a young girl 's dreams ; you travel without fatigue ; you chat pleasantly with your friends ; words come to you with a whole life in each , and fresh pleasures without regrets ; poems are set forth for you in a few brief phrases . The coarse animal satisfaction , in which science has tried to find a soul , is followed by the enchanted drowsiness that men sigh for under the burden of consciousness . Is it not because they all feel the need of absolute repose ? Because Excess is a sort of toll that genius pays to pain ?
67915	67962	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Look at all great men ; nature made them pleasure - loving or base , every one . Some mocking or jealous power corrupted them in either soul or body , so as to make all their powers futile , and their efforts of no avail .
67963	68020	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" All men and all things appear before you in the guise you choose , in those hours when wine has sway . You are lord of all creation ; you transform it at your pleasure . And throughout this unceasing delirium , Play may pour , at your will , its molten lead into your veins .
68021	68112	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Some day you will fall into the monster 's power . Then you will have , as I had , a frenzied awakening , with impotence sitting by your pillow . Are you an old soldier ? Phthisis attacks you . A diplomatist ? An aneurism hangs death in your heart by a thread . It will perhaps be consumption that will cry out to me , ' Let us be going ! ' as to Raphael of Urbino , in old time , killed by an excess of love .
68113	68179	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" In this way I have existed . I was launched into the world too early or too late . My energy would have been dangerous there , no doubt , if I had not have squandered it in such ways as these . Was not the world rid of an Alexander , by the cup of Hercules , at the close of a drinking bout ?
68180	68220	68222	68222	he	1263	" There are some , the sport of Destiny , who must either have heaven or hell , the hospice of St. Bernard or riotous excess . Only just now I lacked the heart to moralize about those two , "
68229	68256	68222	68222	he	1263	" They are types of my own personal history , images of my life ! I could scarcely reproach them ; they stood before me like judges .
68257	68327	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" In the midst of this drama that I was enacting , and while my distracting disorder was at its height , two crises supervened ; each brought me keen and abundant pangs . The first came a few days after I had flung myself , like Sardanapalus , on my pyre . I met Foedora under the peristyle of the Bouffons . We both were waiting for our carriages .
68328	68338	68222	68222	he	1263	" ' Ah ! so you are living yet ? '
68339	68464	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" That was the meaning of her smile , and probably of the spiteful words she murmured in the ear of her cicisbeo , telling him my history no doubt , rating mine as a common love affair . She was deceived , yet she was applauding her perspicacity . Oh , that I should be dying for her , must still adore her , always see her through my potations , see her still when I was overcome with wine , or in the arms of courtesans ; and know that I was a target for her scornful jests ! Oh , that I should be unable to tear the love of her out of my breast and to fling it at her feet !
68465	68562	68222	68222	he	1263	" Well , I quickly exhausted my funds , but owing to those three years of discipline , I enjoyed the most robust health , and on the day that I found myself without a penny I felt remarkably well . In order to carry on the process of dying , I signed bills at short dates , and the day came when they must be met . Painful excitements ! but how they quicken the pulses of youth ! I was not prematurely aged ; I was young yet , and full of vigor and life .
68563	68611	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" At my first debt all my virtues came to life ; slowly and despairingly they seemed to pace towards me ; but I could compound with them -- they were like aged aunts that begin with a scolding and end by bestowing tears and money upon you .
68612	68669	68222	68222	he	1263	" Imagination was less yielding ; I saw my name bandied about through every city in Europe . ' One 's name is oneself ' says Eusebe Salverte . After these excursions I returned to the room I had never quitted , like a doppelganger in a German tale , and came to myself with a start .
68670	68890	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" I used to see with indifference a banker 's messenger going on his errands through the streets of Paris , like a commercial Nemesis , wearing his master 's livery -- a gray coat and a silver badge ; but now I hated the species in advance . One of them came one morning to ask me to meet some eleven bills that I had scrawled my name upon . My signature was worth three thousand francs ! Taking me altogether , I myself was not worth that amount . Sheriff 's deputies rose up before me , turning their callous faces upon my despair , as the hangman regards the criminal to whom he says , ' It has just struck half - past three . ' I was in the power of their clerks ; they could scribble my name , drag it through the mire , and jeer at it . I was a defaulter . Has a debtor any right to himself ? Could not other men call me to account for my way of living ? Why had I eaten puddings _ a la chipolata _ ? Why had I iced my wine ? Why had I slept , or walked , or thought , or amused myself when I had not paid them ?
68891	69000	68222	68222	he	1263	" At any moment , in the middle of a poem , during some train of thought , or while I was gaily breakfasting in the pleasant company of my friends , I might look to see a gentleman enter in a coat of chestnut - brown , with a shabby hat in his hand . This gentleman 's appearance would signify my debt , the bill I had drawn ; the spectre would compel me to leave the table to speak to him , blight my spirits , despoil me of my cheerfulness , of my mistress , of all I possessed , down to my very bedstead .
69001	69081	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Remorse itself is more easily endured . Remorse does not drive us into the street nor into the prison of Sainte - Pelagie ; it does not force us into the detestable sink of vice . Remorse only brings us to the scaffold , where the executioner invests us with a certain dignity ; as we pay the extreme penalty , everybody believes in our innocence ; but people will not credit a penniless prodigal with a single virtue .
69082	69311	68222	68222	he	1263	" My debts had other incarnations . There is the kind that goes about on two feet , in a green cloth coat , and blue spectacles , carrying umbrellas of various hues ; you come face to face with him at the corner of some street , in the midst of your mirth . These have the detestable prerogative of saying , ' M. de Valentin owes me something , and does not pay . I have a hold on him . He had better not show me any offensive airs ! ' You must bow to your creditors , and moreover bow politely . ' When are you going to pay me ? ' say they . And you must lie , and beg money of another man , and cringe to a fool seated on his strong - box , and receive sour looks in return from these horse - leeches ; a blow would be less hateful ; you must put up with their crass ignorance and calculating morality . A debt is a feat of the imaginative that they can not appreciate . A borrower is often carried away and over - mastered by generous impulses ; nothing great , nothing magnanimous can move or dominate those who live for money , and recognize nothing but money . I myself held money in abhorrence .
69312	69389	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" Or a bill may undergo a final transformation into some meritorious old man with a family dependent upon him . My creditor might be a living picture for Greuze , a paralytic with his children round him , a soldier 's widow , holding out beseeching hands to me . Terrible creditors are these with whom we are forced to sympathize , and when their claims are satisfied we owe them a further debt of assistance .
69390	69544	68222	68222	he	1263	" The night before the bills fell due , I lay down with the false calm of those who sleep before their approaching execution , or with a duel in prospect , rocked as they are by delusive hopes . But when I woke , when I was cool and collected , when I found myself imprisoned in a banker 's portfolio , and floundering in statements covered with red ink -- then my debts sprang up everywhere , like grasshoppers , before my eyes . There were my debts , my clock , my armchairs ; my debts were inlaid in the very furniture which I liked best to use . These gentle inanimate slaves were to fall prey to the harpies of the Chatelet , were to be carried off by the broker 's men , and brutally thrown on the market . Ah , my property was a part of myself !
69545	69673	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The sound of the door - bell rang through my heart ; while it seemed to strike at me , where kings should be struck at -- in the head . Mine was a martyrdom , without heaven for its reward . For a magnanimous nature , debt is a hell , and a hell , moreover , with sheriff 's officers and brokers in it . An undischarged debt is something mean and sordid ; it is a beginning of knavery ; it is something worse , it is a lie ; it prepares the way for crime , and brings together the planks for the scaffold . My bills were protested . Three days afterwards I met them , and this is how it happened .
69674	69797	68222	68222	he	1263	" A speculator came , offering to buy the island in the Loire belonging to me , where my mother lay buried . I closed with him . When I went to his solicitor to sign the deeds , I felt a cavern - like chill in the dark office that made me shudder ; it was the same cold dampness that had laid hold upon me at the brink of my father 's grave . I looked upon this as an evil omen . I seemed to see the shade of my mother , and to hear her voice . What power was it that made my own name ring vaguely in my ears , in spite of the clamor of bells ?
69798	69946	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The money paid down for my island , when all my debts were discharged , left me in possession of two thousand francs . I could now have returned to the scholar 's tranquil life , it is true ; I could have gone back to my garret after having gained an experience of life , with my head filled with the results of extensive observation , and with a certain sort of reputation attaching to me . But Foedora 's hold upon her victim was not relaxed . We often met . I compelled her admirers to sound my name in her ears , by dint of astonishing them with my cleverness and success , with my horses and equipages . It all found her impassive and uninterested ; so did an ugly phrase of Rastignac 's , ' He is killing himself for you . '
69947	70055	68222	68222	he	1263	" I charged the world at large with my revenge , but I was not happy . While I was fathoming the miry depths of life , I only recognized the more keenly at all times the happiness of reciprocal affection ; it was a shadow that I followed through all that befell me in my extravagance , and in my wildest moments . It was my misfortune to be deceived in my fairest beliefs , to be punished by ingratitude for benefiting others , and to receive uncounted pleasures as the reward of my errors -- a sinister doctrine , but a true one for the prodigal !
70056	70276	34960	34960	Raphael	360	" The contagious leprosy of Foedora 's vanity had taken hold of me at last . I probed my soul , and found it cankered and rotten . I bore the marks of the devil 's claw upon my forehead . It was impossible to me thenceforward to do without the incessant agitation of a life fraught with danger at every moment , or to dispense with the execrable refinements of luxury . If I had possessed millions , I should still have gambled , reveled , and racketed about . I wished never to be alone with myself , and I must have false friends and courtesans , wine and good cheer to distract me . The ties that attach a man to family life had been permanently broken for me . I had become a galley - slave of pleasure , and must accomplish my destiny of suicide . During the last days of my prosperity , I spent every night in the most incredible excesses ; but every morning death cast me back upon life again . I would have taken a conflagration with as little concern as any man with a life annuity . However , I at last found myself alone with a twenty - franc piece ; I bethought me then of Rastignac 's luck----
70277	70281	68222	68222	he	1263	" Eh , eh!---- "
70365	70371	70372	70372	he	360	" The devil take death ! "
70379	70493	70372	70372	he	360	" I mean to live ! I am rich , I have every virtue ; nothing will withstand me . Who would not be generous , when everything is in his power ? Aha ! Aha ! I wished for two hundred thousand livres a year , and I shall have them . Bow down before me , all of you , wallowing on the carpets like swine in the mire ! You all belong to me -- a precious property truly ! I am rich ; I could buy you all , even the deputy snoring over there . Scum of society , give me your benediction ! I am the Pope . "
70549	70552	70554	70554	Raphael	360	" Silence ! "
70556	70578	70554	70554	Raphael	360	" Back to your kennels , you dogs ! Emile , I have riches , I will give you Havana cigars ! "
70579	70584	70585	70586	the poet	804	" I am listening , "
70589	70621	70585	70586	the poet	804	" Death or Foedora ! On with you ! That silky Foedora deceived you . Women are all daughters of Eve . There is nothing dramatic about that rigmarole of yours . "
70622	70632	70658	70658	he	360	" Ah , but you were sleeping , slyboots . "
70633	70640	70585	70586	the poet	804	" No--'Death or Foedora!'--I have it ! "
70641	70645	70646	70646	Raphael	360	" Wake up ! "
70668	70673	70675	70675	Emile	248	" _ Tonnerre _ ! "
70686	70699	70675	70675	Emile	248	" my friend , remember the sort of women you are with . "
70700	70706	70585	70586	the poet	804	" I am a millionaire ! "
70707	70721	70675	70675	Emile	248	" If you are not a millionaire , you are most certainly drunk . "
70722	70740	70585	70586	the poet	804	" Drunk with power . I can kill you!--Silence ! I am Nero ! I am Nebuchadnezzar ! "
70741	70766	70675	70675	Emile	248	" But , Raphael , we are in queer company , and you ought to keep quiet for the sake of your own dignity . "
70767	70891	70585	70586	the poet	804	" My life has been silent too long . I mean to have my revenge now on the world at large . I will not amuse myself by squandering paltry five - franc pieces ; I will reproduce and sum up my epoch by absorbing human lives , human minds , and human souls . There are the treasures of pestilence -- that is no paltry kind of wealth , is it ? I will wrestle with fevers -- yellow , blue , or green -- with whole armies , with gibbets . I can possess Foedora -- Yet no , I do not want Foedora ; she is a disease ; I am dying of Foedora . I want to forget Foedora . "
70892	70912	70675	70675	Emile	248	" If you keep on calling out like this , I shall take you into the dining - room . "
70913	71019	70585	70586	the poet	804	" Do you see this skin ? It is Solomon 's will . Solomon belongs to me -- a little varlet of a king ! Arabia is mine , Arabia Petraea to boot ; and the universe , and you too , if I choose . If I choose -- Ah ! be careful . I can buy up all our journalist 's shop ; you shall be my valet . You shall be my valet , you shall manage my newspaper . Valet ! _ valet _ , that is to say , free from aches and pains , because he has no brains . "
71034	71038	71039	71039	he	248	" All right , "
71042	71087	71039	71039	he	248	" yes , my friend , I am your valet . But you are about to be editor - in - chief of a newspaper ; so be quiet , and behave properly , for my sake . Have you no regard for me ? "
71088	71136	70675	70675	Emile	248	" Regard for you ! You shall have Havana cigars , with this bit of shagreen : always with this skin , this supreme bit of shagreen . It is a cure for corns , and efficacious remedy . Do you suffer ? I will remove them . "
71137	71145	71039	71039	he	248	" Never have I known you so senseless---- "
71146	71193	70675	70675	Emile	248	" Senseless , my friend ? Not at all . This skin contracts whenever I form a wish--'tis a paradox . There is a Brahmin underneath it ! The Brahmin must be a droll fellow , for our desires , look you , are bound to expand---- "
71194	71198	71039	71039	he	248	" Yes , yes---- "
71199	71203	70675	70675	Emile	248	" I tell you---- "
71204	71222	71039	71039	he	248	" Yes , yes , very true , I am quite of your opinion -- our desires expand---- "
71223	71231	70675	70675	Emile	248	" The skin , I tell you . "
71232	71235	71039	71039	he	248	" Yes . "
71236	71263	70675	70675	Emile	248	" You do n't believe me . I know you , my friend ; you are as full of lies as a new - made king . "
71264	71276	71039	71039	he	248	" How can you expect me to follow your drunken maunderings ? "
71277	71291	70675	70675	Emile	248	" I will bet you I can prove it . Let us measure it---- "
71292	71303	71305	71305	Emile	248	" Goodness ! he will never get off to sleep , "
71367	71378	71345	71345	Valentin	360	" Let us measure it ! Let us measure it ! "
71379	71383	71385	71385	Emile	248	" All right , "
71387	71393	71385	71385	Emile	248	" let us measure it ! "
71440	71472	71423	71423	he	248	" I wished for an income of two hundred thousand livres , did n't I ? Well , when that comes , you will observe a mighty diminution of my chagrin . "
71473	71498	71423	71423	he	248	" Yes -- now go to sleep . Shall I make you comfortable on that sofa ? Now then , are you all right ? "
71499	71544	71423	71423	he	248	" Yes , my nursling of the press . You shall amuse me ; you shall drive the flies away from me . The friend of adversity should be the friend of prosperity . So I will give you some Hava -- na -- cig---- "
71545	71560	71423	71423	he	248	" Come , now , sleep . Sleep off your gold , you millionaire ! "
71561	71587	71423	71423	he	248	" You ! sleep off your paragraphs ! Good - night ! Say good - night to Nebuchadnezzar!--Love ! Wine ! France!--glory and tr -- treas---- "
72507	72539	72487	72487	Emile	248	" You are all as ugly as bailiffs . You wo n't be fit for anything to - day , so this day is lost , and I vote for breakfast . "
72845	72862	72864	72864	Cursy	278	" Oh , ho ! we are to have breakfast in the presence of a notary , "
72866	72877	72879	72880	the banker	610	" You have come here just at the right time , "
72886	72901	72879	72880	the banker	610	" you can jot down the numbers , and initial off all the dishes . "
72902	72921	72923	72938	the scholar , who had made a satisfactory arrangement for the first time in twelve months	1329	" There is no will to make here , but contracts of marriage there may be , perhaps , "
72940	72945	72879	72880	the banker	610	" Oh ! Oh ! "
72946	72951	72997	72997	he	273	" Ah ! Ah ! "
72952	72956	72958	72958	Cardot	273	" One moment , "
72969	72987	72958	72958	Cardot	273	" I came here on serious business . I am bringing six millions for one of you . "
72993	72996	72997	72997	he	273	" Monsieur , "
73023	73033	73012	73012	his	360	" was not your mother a Mlle . O'Flaharty ? "
73034	73037	73039	73039	Raphael	360	" Yes , "
73043	73047	73039	73039	Raphael	360	" Barbara Marie . "
73048	73058	73059	73059	Cardot	273	" Have you your certificate of birth about you , "
73063	73073	73059	73059	Cardot	273	" and Mme . de Valentin 's as well ? "
73074	73079	73059	73059	Cardot	273	" I believe so . "
73080	73104	73059	73059	Cardot	273	" Very well then , monsieur ; you are the sole heir of Major O'Flaharty , who died in August 1828 at Calcutta . "
73105	73112	73114	73115	the critic	1143	" An _ incalcuttable _ fortune , "
73117	73147	73148	73149	the notary	1116	" The Major having bequeathed several amounts to public institutions in his will , the French Government sent in a claim for the remainder to the East India Company , "
73152	73192	73148	73149	the notary	1116	" The estate is clear and ready to be transferred at this moment . I have been looking in vain for the heirs and assigns of Mlle . Barbara Marie O'Flaharty for a fortnight past , when yesterday at dinner---- "
73350	73360	73361	73361	Taillefer	246	" Why , what is the matter with him ? "
73364	73373	73361	73361	Taillefer	246	" He comes by his fortune very cheaply . "
73374	73382	73384	73384	Bixiou	269	" _ Soutiens - le Chatillon _ ! "
73388	73395	73384	73384	Bixiou	269	" The joy will kill him . "
73625	73641	73621	73621	he	360	" Am I not consumptive ? Did not my mother die of a lung complaint ? "
73642	73659	73661	73661	Aquilina	314	" Aha , Raphael ! what fun you will have ! What will you give me ? "
73663	73683	73621	73621	he	360	" Here 's to the death of his uncle , Major O'Flaharty ! There is a man for you . "
73684	73693	73661	73661	Aquilina	314	" He will be a peer of France . "
73694	73706	73708	73710	the amateur critic	1343	" Pooh ! what is a peer of France since July ? "
73712	73724	73661	73661	Aquilina	314	" Are you going to take a box at the Bouffons ? "
73725	73737	73740	73740	Bixiou	269	" You are going to treat us all , I hope ? "
73742	73757	73759	73759	Emile	248	" A man of his sort will be sure to do things in style , "
73902	73910	73911	73912	the banker	610	" Do you wish for some asparagus ? "
73915	73923	73925	73925	Raphael	360	" _ I wish for nothing _ ! "
73927	73930	73931	73931	Taillefer	246	" Bravo ! "
73934	74061	73931	73931	Taillefer	246	" you understand your position ; a fortune confers the privilege of being impertinent . You are one of us . Gentlemen , let us drink to the might of gold ! M. Valentin here , six times a millionaire , has become a power . He is a king , like all the rich ; everything is at his disposal , everything lies under his feet . From this time forth the axiom that ' all Frenchmen are alike in the eyes of the law , ' is for him a fib at the head of the Constitutional Charter . He is not going to obey the law -- the law is going to obey him . There are neither scaffolds nor executioners for millionaires . "
74062	74068	74070	74070	Raphael	360	" Yes , there are , "
74072	74079	74070	74070	Raphael	360	" they are their own executioners . "
74080	74088	74090	74091	the banker	610	" Here is another victim of prejudices ! "
74093	74098	74099	74099	Raphael	360	" Let us drink ! "
74109	74115	74117	74117	Emile	248	" What are you doing ? "
74123	74126	74127	74127	he	248	" Gentlemen , "
74144	74208	74127	74127	he	248	" you must know that our friend Valentin here -- what am I saying?--I mean my Lord Marquis de Valentin -- is in the possession of a secret for obtaining wealth . His wishes are fulfilled as soon as he knows them . He will make us all rich together , or he is a flunkey , and devoid of all decent feeling . "
74209	74224	74225	74225	Euphrasia	315	" Oh , Raphael dear , I should like a set of pearl ornaments ! "
74228	74249	74251	74251	Aquilina	314	" If he has any gratitude in him , he will give me a couple of carriages with fast steppers , "
74253	74264	74127	74127	he	248	" Wish for a hundred thousand a year for me ! "
74265	74269	74127	74127	he	248	" Indian shawls ! "

74289	74308	74127	74127	he	248	" Ten thousand a year in the funds , and I 'll cry quits with you , Raphael ! "
74309	74317	74319	74320	the notary	1116	" Deeds of gift and no mistake , "
74324	74338	74127	74127	he	248	" He ought , at least , to rid me of the gout ! "
74339	74344	74346	74347	the banker	610	" Lower the funds ! "
74381	74386	74387	74387	Emile	248	" My good friend , "
74391	74414	74387	74387	Emile	248	" I shall be quite satisfied with an income of two hundred thousand livres . Please to set about it at once . "
74415	74425	74427	74427	Raphael	360	" Do you not know the cost , Emile ? "
74429	74434	74435	74436	the poet	804	" A nice excuse ! "
74439	74450	74435	74436	the poet	804	" ought we not to sacrifice ourselves for our friends ? "
74451	74465	74466	74466	Valentin	360	" I have almost a mind to wish that you all were dead , "
74481	74488	74490	74490	Emile	248	" Dying people are frightfully cruel , "
74494	74500	74501	74501	he	248	" You are rich now , "
74506	74552	74501	74501	he	248	" very well , I will give you two months at most before you grow vilely selfish . You are so dense already that you can not understand a joke . You have only to go a little further to believe in your Magic Skin . "
74734	74743	74745	74745	he	789	" Classical poet in search of a rhyme . "
74771	74777	74778	74780	the worthy man	1371	" Is Monsieur Raphael in ? "
74788	74796	74798	74799	the servant	1175	" My Lord the Marquis sees nobody , "
74817	74823	74825	74827	the elderly stranger	1374	" There is his carriage , "
74856	74868	74825	74827	the elderly stranger	1374	" He is going out ; I will wait for him . "
74869	74884	74886	74887	the Swiss	1376	" Then you might wait here till to - morrow morning , old boy , "
74889	74927	74886	74887	the Swiss	1376	" A carriage is always waiting for monsieur . Please to go away . If I were to let any stranger come into the house without orders , I should lose an income of six hundred francs . "
74975	74985	74986	74987	the Swiss	1376	" What is more , here is M. Jonathan , "
74990	74995	74986	74987	the Swiss	1376	" speak to him . "
75210	75222	75224	75226	the elderly person	1399	" I should like to speak with M. Raphael , sir , "
75246	75255	75256	75257	the steward	1400	" To speak with my Lord the Marquis ? "
75260	75273	75256	75257	the steward	1400	" He scarcely speaks even to me , his foster - father ! "
75274	75284	75286	75288	the old man	699	" But I am likewise his foster - father , "
75290	75383	75286	75288	the old man	699	" If your wife was his foster - mother , I fed him myself with the milk of the Muses . He is my nursling , my child , carus alumnus ! I formed his mind , cultivated his understanding , developed his genius , and , I venture to say it , to my own honor and glory . Is he not one of the most remarkable men of our epoch ? He was one of my pupils in two lower forms , and in rhetoric . I am his professor . "
75384	75395	75256	75257	the steward	1400	" Ah , sir , then you are M. Porriquet ? "
75396	75402	75286	75288	the old man	699	" Exactly , sir , but---- "
75403	75408	75409	75409	Jonathan	329	" Hush ! hush ! "
75426	75435	75436	75437	the professor	1403	" But is the Marquis ill , sir ? "
75440	75445	75446	75446	Jonathan	329	" My dear sir , "
75449	75687	75446	75446	Jonathan	329	" Heaven only knows what is the matter with my master . You see , there are not a couple of houses like ours anywhere in Paris . Do you understand ? Not two houses . Faith , that there are not . My Lord the Marquis had this hotel purchased for him ; it formerly belonged to a duke and a peer of France ; then he spent three hundred thousand francs over furnishing it . That 's a good deal , you know , three hundred thousand francs ! But every room in the house is a perfect wonder . ' Good , ' said I to myself when I saw this magnificence ; ' it is just like it used to be in the time of my lord , his late grandfather ; and the young marquis is going to entertain all Paris and the Court ! ' Nothing of the kind ! My lord refused to see any one whatever . ' Tis a funny life that he leads , M. Porriquet , you understand . An _ inconciliable _ life . He rises every day at the same time . I am the only person , you see , that may enter his room . I open all the shutters at seven o'clock , summer or winter . It is all arranged very oddly . As I come in I say to him :
75688	75701	75286	75288	the old man	699	" ' You must get up and dress , my Lord Marquis . '
75702	76099	75446	75446	Jonathan	329	" Then he rises and dresses himself . I have to give him his dressing - gown , and it is always after the same pattern , and of the same material . I am obliged to replace it when it can be used no longer , simply to save him the trouble of asking for a new one . A queer fancy ! As a matter of fact , he has a thousand francs to spend every day , and he does as he pleases , the dear child . And besides , I am so fond of him that if he gave me a box on the ear on one side , I should hold out the other to him ! The most difficult things he will tell me to do , and yet I do them , you know ! He gives me a lot of trifles to attend to , that I am well set to work ! He reads the newspapers , does n't he ? Well , my instructions are to put them always in the same place , on the same table . I always go at the same hour and shave him myself ; and do n't I tremble ! The cook would forfeit the annuity of a thousand crowns that he is to come into after my lord 's death , if breakfast is not served _ inconciliably _ at ten o'clock precisely . The menus are drawn up for the whole year round , day after day . My Lord the Marquis has not a thing to wish for . He has strawberries whenever there are any , and he has the earliest mackerel to be had in Paris . The programme is printed every morning . He knows his dinner by rote . In the next place , he dresses himself at the same hour , in the same clothes , the same linen , that I always put on the same chair , you understand ? I have to see that he always has the same cloth ; and if it should happen that his coat came to grief ( a mere supposition ) , I should have to replace it by another without saying a word about it to him . If it is fine , I go in and say to my master :
76100	76110	75286	75288	the old man	699	" ' You ought to go out , sir . '
76111	76617	75446	75446	Jonathan	329	" He says Yes , or No . If he has a notion that he will go out , he does n't wait for his horses ; they are always ready harnessed ; the coachman stops there _ inconciliably _ , whip in hand , just as you see him out there . In the evening , after dinner , my master goes one day to the Opera , the other to the Ital----no , he has n't yet gone to the Italiens , though , for I could not find a box for him until yesterday . Then he comes in at eleven o'clock precisely , to go to bed . At any time in the day when he has nothing to do , he reads -- he is always reading , you see -- it is a notion he has . My instructions are to read the _ Journal de la Librairie _ before he sees it , and to buy new books , so that he finds them on his chimney - piece on the very day that they are published . I have orders to go into his room every hour or so , to look after the fire and everything else , and to see that he wants nothing . He gave me a little book , sir , to learn off by heart , with all my duties written in it -- a regular catechism ! In summer I have to keep a cool and even temperature with blocks of ice and at all seasons to put fresh flowers all about . He is rich ! He has a thousand francs to spend every day ; he can indulge his fancies ! And he had n't even necessaries for so long , poor child ! He does n't annoy anybody ; he is as good as gold ; he never opens his mouth , for instance ; the house and garden are absolutely silent . In short , my master has not a single wish left ; everything comes in the twinkling of an eye , if he raises his hand , and _ instanter _ . Quite right , too . If servants are not looked after , everything falls into confusion . You would never believe the lengths he goes about things . His rooms are all -- what do you call it?--er -- er--_en suite _ . Very well ; just suppose , now , that he opens his room door or the door of his study ; presto ! all the other doors fly open of themselves by a patent contrivance ; and then he can go from one end of the house to the other and not find a single door shut ; which is all very nice and pleasant and convenient for us great folk ! But , on my word , it cost us a lot of money ! And , after all , M. Porriquet , he said to me at last :
76618	76714	76940	76940	Porriquet	406	" ' Jonathan , you will look after me as if I were a baby in long clothes , ' Yes , sir , ' long clothes ! ' those were his very words . ' You will think of all my requirements for me . ' I am the master , so to speak , and he is the servant , you understand ? The reason of it ? Ah , my word , that is just what nobody on earth knows but himself and God Almighty . It is quite _ inconciliable _ ! "
76715	76722	76724	76726	the old professor	1404	" He is writing a poem ! "
76728	76800	76940	76940	Porriquet	406	" You think he is writing a poem , sir ? It 's a very absorbing affair , then ! But , you know , I do n't think he is . He often tells me that he wants to live like a _ vergetation _ ; he wants to _ vergetate _ . Only yesterday he was looking at a tulip while he was dressing , and he said to me :
76801	76837	76940	76940	Porriquet	406	" ' There is my own life -- I am _ vergetating _ , my poor Jonathan . ' Now , some of them insist that that is monomania . It is _ inconciliable _ ! "
76838	76850	76851	76852	the professor	1403	" All this makes it very clear to me , Jonathan , "
76866	76915	76862	76864	the old servant	1406	" that your master is absorbed in a great work . He is deep in vast meditations , and has no wish to be distracted by the petty preoccupations of ordinary life . A man of genius forgets everything among his intellectual labors . One day the famous Newton---- "
76916	76928	76930	76930	Jonathan	329	" Newton?--oh , ah ! I do n't know the name , "
76932	76939	76940	76940	Porriquet	406	" Newton , a great geometrician , "
76944	77003	76940	76940	Porriquet	406	" once sat for twenty - four hours leaning his elbow on the table ; when he emerged from his musings , he was a day out in his reckoning , just as if he had been sleeping . I will go to see him , dear lad ; I may perhaps be of some use to him . "
77004	77010	77011	77011	Jonathan	329	" Not for a moment ! "
77014	77142	77011	77011	Jonathan	329	" Not though you were King of France -- I mean the real old one . You could not go in unless you forced the doors open and walked over my body . But I will go and tell him you are here , M. Porriquet , and I will put it to him like this , ' Ought he to come up ? ' And he will say Yes or No . I never say , ' Do you wish ? ' or ' Will you ? ' or ' Do you want ? ' Those words are scratched out of the dictionary . He let out at me once with a ' Do you want to kill me ? ' he was so very angry . "
77795	77803	77807	77807	himself	360	" I will be like that man , "
77928	77935	77937	77937	Raphael	360	" Good day , pere Porriquet , "
77952	77957	77937	77937	Raphael	360	" how are you ? "
77958	77964	77966	77967	the other	855	" I am very well , "
77978	77984	77966	77967	the other	855	" But how about you ? "
77985	77997	77937	77937	Raphael	360	" Oh , I am hoping to keep myself in health . "
77998	78010	77966	77967	the other	855	" You are engaged in some great work , no doubt ? "
78011	78014	78015	78015	Raphael	360	" No , "
78018	78051	78015	78015	Raphael	360	" Exegi monumemtum , pere Porriquet ; I have contributed an important page to science , and have now bidden her farewell for ever . I scarcely know where my manuscript is . "
78052	78060	78062	78063	the schoolmaster	1436	" The style is no doubt correct ? "
78065	78094	78062	78063	the schoolmaster	1436	" You , I hope , would never have adopted the barbarous language of the new school , which fancies it has worked such wonders by discovering Ronsard ! "
78095	78105	77966	77967	the other	855	" My work treats of physiology pure and simple . "
78106	78119	78120	78121	the schoolmaster	1436	" Oh , then , there is no more to be said , "
78124	78175	78179	78179	himself	1436	" Grammar must yield to the exigencies of discovery . Nevertheless , young man , a lucid and harmonious style -- the diction of Massillon , of M. de Buffon , of the great Racine -- a classical style , in short , can never spoil anything----But , my friend , "
78181	78197	78179	78179	himself	1436	" I was forgetting the object of my visit , which concerns my own interests . "
78591	78599	78600	78600	he	414	" Well , my dear pere Porriquet , "
78616	78639	78600	78600	he	414	" but I can do nothing for you , nothing at all . _ I wish very heartily _ that you may succeed---- "
78713	78719	78720	78720	he	414	" Old fool ! Go ! "
78723	78792	78720	78720	he	414	" You will be appointed as headmaster ! Could n't you have asked me for an annuity of a thousand crowns rather than a murderous wish ? Your visit would have cost me nothing . There are a hundred thousand situations to be had in France , but I have only one life . A man 's life is worth more than all the situations in the world.--Jonathan ! "
78796	78818	78820	78820	he	329	" This is your doing , double - distilled idiot ! What made you suggest that I should see M. Porriquet ? "
78833	78931	78820	78820	he	329	" Did I put myself in your hands for you to tear me in pieces ? You have just shortened my life by ten years ! Another blunder of this kind , and you will lay me where I have laid my father . Would I not far rather have possessed the beautiful Foedora ? And I have obliged that old hulk instead -- that rag of humanity ! I had money enough for him . And , moreover , if all the Porriquets in the world were dying of hunger , what is that to me ? "
79003	79009	79010	79010	he	493	" Oh , my life ! "
79013	79039	79010	79010	he	493	" that fair life of mine . Never to know a kindly thought again , to love no more ; nothing is left to me ! "
79051	79085	79040	79040	He	493	voice--"The harm is done , my old friend . Your services have been well repaid ; and my misfortune has at any rate contributed to the welfare of a good and worthy man . "
79119	79124	79126	79126	Porriquet	406	" He is epileptic , "
79128	79138	79139	79139	Raphael	360	" I understand your kind intentions , my friend , "
79143	79170	79171	79171	he	493	" You would make excuses for me . Ill - health can not be helped , but ingratitude is a grievous fault . Leave me now , "
79174	79203	79171	79171	he	493	" To - morrow or the next day , or possibly to - night , you will receive your appointment ; Resistance has triumphed over Motion . Farewell . "
79264	79272	79274	79276	the young man	493	" Now attend to me , Jonathan , "
79282	79292	79274	79276	the young man	493	" Try to understand the charge confided to you . "
79293	79300	79278	79280	his old servant	1472	" Yes , my Lord Marquis . "
79301	79311	79274	79276	the young man	493	" I am as a man outlawed from humanity . "
79312	79319	79278	79280	his old servant	1472	" Yes , my Lord Marquis . "
79320	79369	79274	79276	the young man	493	" All the pleasures of life disport themselves round my bed of death , and dance about me like fair women ; but if I beckon to them , I must die . Death always confronts me . You must be the barrier between the world and me . "
79370	79377	79379	79381	the old servant	1406	" Yes , my Lord Marquis , "
79393	79451	79379	79381	the old servant	1406	" But if you do n't wish to see pretty women , how will you manage at the Italiens this evening ? An English family is returning to London , and I have taken their box for the rest of the season , and it is in a splendid position -- superb ; in the first row . "
79467	79628	79452	79452	Raphael	360	" Do you see that splendid equipage , a brougham painted a dark brown color , but with the arms of an ancient and noble family shining from the panels ? As it rolls past , all the shop - girls admire it , and look longingly at the yellow satin lining , the rugs from la Savonnerie , the daintiness and freshness of every detail , the silken cushions and tightly - fitting glass windows . Two liveried footmen are mounted behind this aristocratic carriage ; and within , a head lies back among the silken cushions , the feverish face and hollow eyes of Raphael , melancholy and sad . Emblem of the doom of wealth ! He flies across Paris like a rocket , and reaches the peristyle of the Theatre Favart . The passers - by make way for him ; the two footmen help him to alight , an envious crowd looking on the while . "
79629	79640	79642	79646	a poor law - student	1474	" What has that fellow done to be so rich ? "
79844	79852	79853	79853	he	360	" What a wonderful bit of painting ! "
80616	80630	80632	80637	a dandy of the Romantic faction	1529	" In what cemetery did this young ghoul unearth that corpse of hers ? "
80684	80690	80692	80692	Raphael	383	" How many old men , "
80696	80726	80692	80692	Raphael	383	" bring an upright , virtuous , and hard - working life to a close in folly ! His feet are cold already , and he is making love . "
80727	80732	80734	80734	Valentin	360	" Well , sir , "
80749	80761	80743	80743	he	360	" have you quite forgotten the stringent maxims of your philosophy ? "
80762	80775	80777	80778	the other	855	" Ah , I am as happy now as a young man , "
80785	80808	80777	80778	the other	855	" I used to look at existence from a wrong standpoint . One hour of love has a whole life in it . "
81329	81336	81315	81315	Her	341	" I am the most beautiful , "
81640	81653	81626	81626	Emile	248	" Just look at that lovely creature there , close beside you ! "
82181	82184	82149	82150	the stranger	502	" Pauline ! "
82185	82189	82190	82190	Each	856	" M. Raphael ! "
82279	82295	82296	82296	she	336	" Come to the Hotel de Saint - Quentin to - morrow for your papers , "
82299	82310	82296	82296	she	336	" I will be there at noon . Be punctual . "
82373	82376	82377	82377	he	360	" Jonathan , "
82392	82420	82377	82377	he	360	" give me half a drop of laudanum on a piece of sugar , and do n't wake me to - morrow till twenty minutes to twelve . "
82421	82429	82430	82430	he	360	" I want Pauline to love me ! "
82474	82477	82479	82479	Raphael	360	" Ah ! "
82509	82544	82557	82557	he	360	" so you are playing me false , you are not obeying me , the pact is broken ! I am free ; I shall live . Then was it all a wretched joke ? "
82752	82764	82738	82740	an old woman	3333	" You are M. Raphael de Valentin , are you not ? "
82765	82771	82772	82772	he	360	" Yes , good mother , "
82775	82783	82784	82784	she	3333	" You know your old room then , "
82787	82794	82784	82784	she	3333	" you are expected up there . "
82795	82805	82806	82806	Raphael	360	" Does Mme . Gaudin still own the house ? "
82809	82912	82784	82784	she	3333	" Oh no , sir . Mme . Gaudin is a baroness now . She lives in a fine house of her own on the other side of the river . Her husband has come back . My goodness , he brought back thousands and thousands . They say she could buy up all the Quartier Saint - Jacques if she liked . She gave me her basement room for nothing , and the remainder of her lease . Ah , she 's a kind woman all the same ; she is no more proud to - day than she was yesterday . "
82979	82986	82988	82988	Pauline	336	" Ah , there you are ! "
83021	83029	83030	83030	she	336	" Why did you leave us then ? "
83044	83050	83030	83030	she	336	" What became of you ? "
83051	83068	83005	83005	her	336	" Ah , I have been very miserable , Pauline ; I am very miserable still . "
83069	83072	83073	83073	she	336	" Alas ! "
83081	83120	83073	83073	she	336	" I guessed your fate yesterday when I saw you so well dressed , and apparently so wealthy ; but in reality ? Eh , M. Raphael , is it as it always used to be with you ? "
83133	83136	83137	83137	he	360	" Pauline , "
83140	83142	83137	83137	he	360	" I---- "
83161	83172	83174	83174	Pauline	336	" Oh , he loves me ! he loves me ! "
83211	83347	83199	83199	she	3446	" Rich , rich , happy and rich ! Your Pauline is rich . But I ? Oh , I ought to be very poor to - day . I have said , times without number , that I would give all the wealth upon this earth for those words , ' He loves me ! ' O my Raphael ! I have millions . You like luxury , you will be glad ; but you must love me and my heart besides , for there is so much love for you in my heart . You do n't know ? My father has come back . I am a wealthy heiress . Both he and my mother leave me completely free to decide my own fate . I am free -- do you understand ? "
83429	83440	83442	83442	Pauline	336	" Ah , I will not leave you any more , "
83450	83463	83464	83464	she	336	" I do not know how I come to be so bold ! "
83469	83498	83624	83624	she	1626	" Bold , my Pauline ? Do not fear it . It is love , love true and deep and everlasting like my own , is it not ? "
83499	83502	83503	83503	she	336	" Speak ! "
83506	83521	83503	83503	she	336	" Go on speaking , so long your lips have been dumb for me . "
83522	83531	83624	83624	she	1626	" Then you have loved me all along ? "
83532	83623	83624	83624	she	1626	" Loved you ? _ Mon Dieu _ ! How often I have wept here , setting your room straight , and grieving for your poverty and my own . I would have sold myself to the evil one to spare you one vexation ! You are MY Raphael to - day , really my own Raphael , with that handsome head of yours , and your heart is mine too ; yes , that above all , your heart -- O wealth inexhaustible ! Well , where was I ? "
83631	83737	83739	83739	she	1627	" Oh yes ! We have three , four , or five millions , I believe . If I were poor , I should perhaps desire to bear your name , to be acknowledged as your wife ; but as it is , I would give up the whole world for you , I would be your servant still , now and always . Why , Raphael , if I give you my fortune , my heart , myself to - day , I do no more than I did that day when I put a certain five - franc piece in the drawer there , "
83745	83755	83739	83739	she	1627	" Oh , how your exultation hurt me then ! "
83756	83764	83765	83765	Raphael	360	" Oh , why are you rich ? "
83768	83784	83765	83765	Raphael	360	" why is there no vanity in you ? I can do nothing for you . "
83796	83823	83765	83765	Raphael	360	" When you are the Marquise de Valentin , I know that the title and the fortune for thee , heavenly soul , will not be worth---- "
83824	83831	83832	83832	she	1627	" One hair of your head , "
83835	83866	83765	83765	Raphael	360	" I have millions too . But what is wealth to either of us now ? There is my life -- ah , that I can offer , take it . "
83867	83896	83936	83936	She	1627	" Your love , Raphael , your love is all the world to me . Are your thoughts of me ? I am the happiest of the happy ! "
83897	83904	83906	83906	Raphael	360	" Can any one overhear us ? "
83908	83911	83912	83912	she	1627	" Nobody , "
83922	83927	83929	83929	Valentin	360	" Come , then ! "
83949	83953	83954	83954	she	1627	" Kiss me ! "
83957	83997	83936	83936	She	1627	" after all the pain you have given me ; to blot out the memory of the grief that your joys have caused me ; and for the sake of the nights that I spent in painting hand - screens---- "
83998	84006	83936	83936	She	1627	" Those hand - screens of yours ? "
84007	84110	84111	84111	she	1628	" Now that we are rich , my darling , I can tell you all about it . Poor boy ! how easy it is to delude a clever man ! Could you have had white waistcoats and clean shirts twice a week for three francs every month to the laundress ? Why , you used to drink twice as much milk as your money would have paid for . I deceived you all round -- over firing , oil , and even money . O Raphael mine , do n't have me for your wife , I am far too cunning ! "
84115	84122	83936	83936	She	1627	" But how did you manage ? "
84123	84155	84240	84240	She	1628	" I used to work till two o'clock in the morning ; I gave my mother half the money made by my screens , and the other half went to you . "
84172	84188	84190	84190	Raphael	360	" Some day we shall have to pay for this happiness by some terrible sorrow , "
84192	84198	84200	84200	Pauline	336	" Perhaps you are married ? "
84202	84216	84200	84200	Pauline	336	" Oh , I will not give you up to any other woman . "
84217	84225	84240	84240	She	1628	" I am free , my beloved . "
84226	84229	84230	84230	she	1628	" Free ! "
84233	84239	84230	84230	she	1628	" Free , and mine ! "
84261	84275	84276	84276	she	1628	" I am afraid I shall go mad . How handsome you are ! "
84290	84370	84276	84276	she	1628	" How stupid your Countess Foedora is ! How pleased I was yesterday with the homage they all paid to me ! SHE has never been applauded . Dear , when I felt your arm against my back , I heard a vague voice within me that cried , ' He is there ! ' and I turned round and saw you . I fled , for I longed so to throw my arms about you before them all . "
84371	84381	84382	84382	Raphael	360	" How happy you are -- you can speak ! "
84385	84430	84382	84382	Raphael	360	" My heart is overwhelmed ; I would weep , but I can not . Do not draw your hand away . I could stay here looking at you like this for the rest of my life , I think ; happy and content . "
84431	84441	84276	84276	she	1628	" O my love , say that once more ! "
84442	84449	84451	84451	Valentin	360	" Ah , what are words ? "
84463	84484	84451	84451	Valentin	360	" Some time I will try to tell you of my love ; just now I can only feel it . "
84485	84488	84489	84489	she	336	" You , "
84492	84523	84489	84489	she	336	" with your lofty soul and your great genius , with that heart of yours that I know so well ; are you really mine , as I am yours ? "
84524	84534	84536	84536	Raphael	360	" For ever and ever , my sweet creature , "
84542	84629	84630	84630	he	360	" You shall be my wife , my protecting angel . My griefs have always been dispelled by your presence , and my courage revived ; that angelic smile now on your lips has purified me , so to speak . A new life seems about to begin for me . The cruel past and my wretched follies are hardly more to me than evil dreams . At your side I breathe an atmosphere of happiness , and I am pure . Be with me always , "
84641	84649	84651	84651	Pauline	336	" Death may come when it will , "
84655	84660	84651	84651	Pauline	336	" I have lived ! "
84676	84692	84694	84694	Pauline	336	" I wish that no one might enter this dear garret again , my Raphael , "
84702	84722	84723	84724	the Marquis	4624	" We must have the door walled up , put bars across the window , and buy the house , "
84727	84733	84734	84734	she	336	" Yes , we will , "
84744	84758	84741	84741	she	336	" Our search for your manuscripts has been a little lost sight of , "
84766	84783	84784	84784	Raphael	360	" Pshaw ! I do n't care a jot for the whole circle of the sciences , "
84787	84797	84741	84741	she	336	" Ah , sir , and how about glory ? "
84798	84805	84741	84741	she	336	" I glory in you alone . "
84806	84822	84823	84823	she	336	" You used to be very miserable as you made these little scratches and scrawls , "
84831	84834	84741	84741	she	336	" My Pauline---- "
84835	84848	84741	84741	she	336	" Oh yes , I am your Pauline -- and what then ? "
84849	84856	84741	84741	she	336	" Where are you living now ? "
84857	84867	84741	84741	she	336	" In the Rue Saint Lazare . And you ? "
84868	84875	84741	84741	she	336	" In the Rue de Varenne . "
84876	84886	84887	84887	She	336	" What a long way apart we shall be until---- "
84902	84916	84917	84917	Raphael	360	" But at the most we need only be separated for a fortnight , "
84920	84932	84934	84934	she	336	" Really ! we are to be married in a fortnight ? "
84942	84949	84950	84950	she	336	" I am an unnatural daughter ! "
84954	85014	85015	85015	she	336	" I give no more thought to my father or my mother , or to anything in the world . Poor love , you do n't know that my father is very ill ? He returned from the Indies in very bad health . He nearly died at Havre , where we went to find him . Good heavens ! "
85023	85106	85015	85015	she	336	" it is three o'clock already ! I ought to be back again when he wakes at four . I am mistress of the house at home ; my mother does everything that I wish , and my father worships me ; but I will not abuse their kindness , that would be wrong . My poor father ! He would have me go to the Italiens yesterday . You will come to see him to - morrow , will you not ? "
85107	85121	85175	85175	Raphael	360	" Will Madame la Marquise de Valentin honor me by taking my arm ? "
85122	85137	85138	85138	she	1638	" I am going to take the key of this room away with me , "
85141	85151	85138	85138	she	1638	" Is n't our treasure - house a palace ? "
85152	85159	85175	85175	Raphael	360	" One more kiss , Pauline . "
85160	85169	85170	85170	she	1638	" A thousand , _ mon Dieu _ ! "
85177	85193	85170	85170	she	1638	" Will it always be like this ? I feel as if I were dreaming . "
85251	85260	85261	85261	she	1638	" I want to go home with you , "
85264	85293	85294	85294	she	1638	" I want to see your own room and your study , and to sit at the table where you work . It will be like old times , "
85305	85344	85299	85299	She	1638	" Joseph , before returning home I am going to the Rue de Varenne . It is a quarter - past three now , and I must be back by four o'clock . George must hurry the horses . "
85359	85372	85373	85373	Pauline	336	" How glad I am to have seen all this for myself ! "
85390	85432	85373	85373	Pauline	336	" As I go to sleep , I shall be here in thought . I shall imagine your dear head on the pillow there . Raphael , tell me , did no one advise you about the furniture of your hotel ? "
85433	85438	85373	85373	Pauline	336	" No one whatever . "
85439	85448	85373	85373	Pauline	336	" Really ? It was not a woman who---- "
85449	85452	85373	85373	Pauline	336	" Pauline ! "
85453	85479	85373	85373	Pauline	336	" Oh , I know I am fearfully jealous . You have good taste . I will have a bed like yours to - morrow . "
85493	85499	85500	85500	she	336	" Oh , my father ! "
85503	85506	85500	85500	she	336	" my father---- "
85507	85516	85518	85518	Valentin	360	" I will take you back to him , "
85520	85534	85518	85518	Valentin	360	" for I want to be away from you as little as possible . "
85535	85548	85500	85500	she	336	" How loving you are ! I did not venture to suggest it---- "
85549	85556	85518	85518	Valentin	360	" Are you not my life ? "
85724	85728	85729	85729	he	360	" Good God ! "
85732	85743	85729	85729	he	360	" every wish ! Every desire of mine ! Poor Pauline!---- "
85763	85772	85773	85773	he	360	" I have scarcely enough for two months ! "
85800	85807	85792	85792	he	360	" I am a perfect fool ! "
85827	85834	85836	85836	he	360	" _ Vogue la galere _ , "
85838	85846	85836	85836	he	360	" The devil take all this nonsense . "
86706	86715	86716	86716	she	336	" I am quite jealous of the paper , "
86735	86745	86746	86746	she	336	" Now , is it not a heinous offence , "
86759	86787	86746	86746	she	336	" to read Russian proclamations in my presence , and to attend to the prosings of the Emperor Nicholas rather than to looks and words of love ! "
86788	86804	86818	86819	the gardener	1679	" I was not reading , my dear angel ; I was looking at you . "
86825	86959	86818	86819	the gardener	1679	" I beg your pardon , my Lord Marquis -- and yours , too , madame -- if I am intruding , but I have brought you a curiosity the like of which I never set eyes on . Drawing a bucket of water just now , with due respect , I got out this strange salt - water plant . Here it is . It must be thoroughly used to water , anyhow , for it is n't saturated or even damp at all . It is as dry as a piece of wood , and has not swelled a bit . As my Lord Marquis certainly knows a great deal more about things than I do , I thought I ought to bring it , and that it would interest him . "
86981	86986	86987	86987	Raphael	360	" Thanks , Vaniere , "
86990	86997	86987	86987	Raphael	360	" The thing is very curious . "
86998	87015	87016	87016	Pauline	336	" What is the matter with you , my angel ; you are growing quite white ! "
87019	87026	86987	86987	Raphael	360	" You can go , Vaniere . "
87027	87033	87034	87035	the girl	3349	" Your voice frightens me , "
87039	87071	87072	87072	she	3349	" it is so strangely altered . What is it ? How are you feeling ? Where is the pain ? You are in pain!--Jonathan ! here ! call a doctor ! "
87075	87081	87082	87082	Raphael	360	" Hush , my Pauline , "
87090	87118	87082	87082	Raphael	360	" Let us get up and go . Some flower here has a scent that is too much for me . It is that verbena , perhaps . "
87174	87178	87179	87179	she	336	" Dear angel , "
87182	87246	87247	87247	she	336	" when I saw you turn so white , I understood that I could not live on without you ; your life is my life too . Lay your hand on my back , Raphael mine ; I feel a chill like death . The feeling of cold is there yet . Your lips are burning . How is your hand?--Cold as ice , "
87250	87254	87256	87256	Raphael	360	" Mad girl ! "
87258	87268	87316	87316	she	336	" Why that tear ? Let me drink it . "
87269	87282	87316	87316	she	336	" O Pauline , Pauline , you love me far too much ! "
87283	87315	87316	87316	she	336	" There is something very extraordinary going on in your mind , Raphael ! Do not dissimulate . I shall very soon find out your secret . Give that to me , "
87325	87331	87332	87334	the young man	493	" You are my executioner ! "
87344	87351	87353	87353	Pauline	336	" How changed your voice is ! "
87364	87370	87371	87371	he	493	" Do you love me ? "
87374	87385	87332	87334	the young man	493	" Do I love you ? Is there any doubt ? "
87386	87395	87332	87334	the young man	493	" Then , leave me , go away ! "
87401	87404	87406	87406	Raphael	360	" So ! "
87413	87527	87406	87406	Raphael	360	" In an enlightened age , when we have found out that diamonds are a crystallized form of charcoal , at a time when everything is made clear , when the police would hale a new Messiah before the magistrates , and submit his miracles to the Academie des Sciences -- in an epoch when we no longer believe in anything but a notary 's signature -- that I , forsooth , should believe in a sort of _ Mene , Tekel , Upharsin _ ! No , by Heaven , I will not believe that the Supreme Being would take pleasure in torturing a harmless creature.--Let us see the learned about it . "
87644	87650	87654	87655	the keepers	1693	" That is M. Lavrille , "
87782	87784	87800	87801	the naturalist	1701	" I "
87908	87918	87919	87920	the naturalist	1701	" Oh , we are well off for ducks , "
87923	88023	87919	87920	the naturalist	1701	" The genus , moreover , as you doubtless know , is the most prolific in the order of palmipeds . It begins with the swan and ends with the zin - zin duck , comprising in all one hundred and thirty - seven very distinct varieties , each having its own name , habits , country , and character , and every one no more like another than a white man is like a negro . Really , sir , when we dine off a duck , we have no notion for the most part of the vast extent---- "
88043	88136	88137	88137	he	360	" There you see the cravatted swan , a poor native of Canada ; he has come a very long way to show us his brown and gray plumage and his little black cravat ! Look , he is preening himself . That one is the famous eider duck that provides the down , the eider - down under which our fine ladies sleep ; is n't it pretty ? Who would not admire the little pinkish white breast and the green beak ? I have just been a witness , sir , "
88141	88202	88203	88203	he	360	" to a marriage that I had long despaired of bringing about ; they have paired rather auspiciously , and I shall await the results very eagerly . This will be a hundred and thirty - eighth species , I flatter myself , to which , perhaps , my name will be given . That is the newly matched pair , "
88213	88354	88203	88203	he	360	" one of them is a laughing goose ( _ anas albifrons _ ) , and the other the great whistling duck , Buffon 's _ anas ruffina _ . I have hesitated a long while between the whistling duck , the duck with white eyebrows , and the shoveler duck ( _ anas clypeata _ ) . Stay , that is the shoveler -- that fat , brownish black rascal , with the greenish neck and that coquettish iridescence on it . But the whistling duck was a crested one , sir , and you will understand that I deliberated no longer . We only lack the variegated black - capped duck now . These gentlemen here , unanimously claim that that variety of duck is only a repetition of the curve - beaked teal , but for my own part,"--and
88391	88399	88400	88400	he	360	" I do n't think it is , "
88403	88440	88400	88400	he	360	" You see , my dear sir , that we are not amusing ourselves here . I am engaged at this moment upon a monograph on the genus duck . But I am at your disposal . "
88465	88471	88479	88479	he	1145	" I know the product , "
88489	88540	88479	88479	he	1145	" It used to be used for covering boxes . The shagreen is very old . They prefer to use skate 's skin nowadays for making sheaths . This , as you are doubtless aware , is the hide of the _ raja sephen _ , a Red Sea fish . "
88541	88553	88565	88565	he	1145	" But this , sir , since you are so exceedingly good---- "
88554	88557	88558	88561	the man of science	1145	" This , "
88568	88619	88620	88620	he	1145	" this is quite another thing ; between these two shagreens , sir , there is a difference just as wide as between sea and land , or fish and flesh . The fish 's skin is harder , however , than the skin of the land animal . This , "
88629	88646	88624	88624	he	1145	" is , as you doubtless know , one of the most curious of zoological products . "
88647	88651	88653	88653	Raphael	360	" But to proceed---- "
88655	88658	88660	88663	the man of science	1145	" This , "
88674	88683	88666	88666	he	1145	" is an ass ' skin , sir . "
88684	88690	88692	88694	the young man	493	" Yes , I know , "
88696	88707	88708	88709	the naturalist	1701	" A very rare variety of ass found in Persia , "
88712	88877	88708	88709	the naturalist	1701	" the onager of the ancients , equus asinus , the _ koulan _ of the Tartars ; Pallas went out there to observe it , and has made it known to science , for as a matter of fact the animal for a long time was believed to be mythical . It is mentioned , as you know , in Holy Scripture ; Moses forbade that it should be coupled with its own species , and the onager is yet more famous for the prostitutions of which it was the object , and which are often mentioned by the prophets of the Bible . Pallas , as you know doubtless , states in his _ Act . Petrop . _ tome II . , that these bizarre excesses are still devoutly believed in among the Persians and the Nogais as a sovereign remedy for lumbago and sciatic gout . We poor Parisians scarcely believe that . The Museum has no example of the onager .
88878	88884	88885	88885	he	1701	" What a magnificent animal ! "
88888	89441	88885	88885	he	1701	" It is full of mystery ; its eyes are provided with a sort of burnished covering , to which the Orientals attribute the powers of fascination ; it has a glossier and finer coat than our handsomest horses possess , striped with more or less tawny bands , very much like the zebra 's hide . There is something pliant and silky about its hair , which is sleek to the touch . Its powers of sight vie in precision and accuracy with those of man ; it is rather larger than our largest domestic donkeys , and is possessed of extraordinary courage . If it is surprised by any chance , it defends itself against the most dangerous wild beasts with remarkable success ; the rapidity of its movements can only be compared with the flight of birds ; an onager , sir , would run the best Arab or Persian horses to death . According to the father of the conscientious Doctor Niebuhr , whose recent loss we are deploring , as you doubtless know , the ordinary average pace of one of these wonderful creatures would be seven thousand geometric feet per hour . Our own degenerate race of donkeys can give no idea of the ass in his pride and independence . He is active and spirited in his demeanor ; he is cunning and sagacious ; there is grace about the outlines of his head ; every movement is full of attractive charm . In the East he is the king of beasts . Turkish and Persian superstition even credits him with a mysterious origin ; and when stories of the prowess attributed to him are told in Thibet or in Tartary , the speakers mingle Solomon 's name with that of this noble animal . A tame onager , in short , is worth an enormous amount ; it is well - nigh impossible to catch them among the mountains , where they leap like roebucks , and seem as if they could fly like birds . Our myth of the winged horse , our Pegasus , had its origin doubtless in these countries , where the shepherds could see the onager springing from one rock to another . In Persia they breed asses for the saddle , a cross between a tamed onager and a she - ass , and they paint them red , following immemorial tradition . Perhaps it was this custom that gave rise to our own proverb , ' Surely as a red donkey . ' At some period when natural history was much neglected in France , I think a traveler must have brought over one of these strange beasts that endures servitude with such impatience . Hence the adage . The skin that you have laid before me is the skin of an onager . Opinions differ as to the origin of the name . Some claim that _ Chagri _ is a Turkish word ; others insist that _ Chagri _ must be the name of the place where this animal product underwent the chemical process of preparation so clearly described by Pallas , to which the peculiar graining that we admire is due ; Martellens has written to me saying that _ Chaagri _ is a river---- "
89442	89504	89506	89506	Raphael	360	" I thank you , sir , for the information that you have given me ; it would furnish an admirable footnote for some Dom Calmet or other , if such erudite hermits yet exist ; but I have had the honor of pointing out to you that this scrap was in the first instance quite as large as that map , "
89515	89526	89506	89506	Raphael	360	" but it has shrunk visibly in three months ' time---- "
89527	89531	89533	89536	the man of science	1145	" Quite so , "
89538	89629	89533	89536	the man of science	1145	" I understand . The remains of any substance primarily organic are naturally subject to a process of decay . It is quite easy to understand , and its progress depends upon atmospherical conditions . Even metals contract and expand appreciably , for engineers have remarked somewhat considerable interstices between great blocks of stone originally clamped together with iron bars . The field of science is boundless , but human life is very short , so that we do not claim to be acquainted with all the phenomena of nature . "
89630	89644	89645	89645	Raphael	360	" Pardon the question that I am about to ask you , sir , "
89651	89678	89645	89645	Raphael	360	" but are you quite sure that this piece of skin is subject to the ordinary laws of zoology , and that it can be stretched ? "
89679	89683	89685	89686	M. Lavrille	426	" Certainly----oh , bother!---- "
89694	89707	89708	89708	he	360	" But if you , sir , will go to see Planchette , "
89711	89736	89708	89708	he	360	" the celebrated professor of mechanics , he will certainly discover some method of acting upon this skin , of softening and expanding it . "
89737	89750	89752	89752	Raphael	360	" Ah , sir , you are the preserver of my life , "
89894	89904	89906	89906	he	360	" I shall keep my ass well in hand , "
89915	89933	89908	89908	Sterne	189	" Let us take care of our ass , if we wish to live to old age . "
90128	90160	90115	90119	The modest man of science	1728	" What is that invention of mine ? Nothing whatever . Man can not create a force ; he can but direct it ; and science consists in learning from nature . "
90280	90285	90286	90286	he	1371	" It is inexplicable , "
90289	90297	90298	90298	he	1371	" Ah , your servant , sir , "
90309	90323	90298	90298	he	1371	" How is your mother ? You must go and see my wife . "
90324	90333	90335	90335	Raphael	360	" And I also could have lived thus , "
90365	90375	90338	90338	he	360	" Although my credulity must amuse you , sir , "
90381	90404	90377	90378	the Marquis	4624	" I will conceal nothing from you . That skin seems to me to be endowed with an insuperable power of resistance . "
90405	90418	90420	90420	Planchette	436	" People of fashion , sir , always treat science rather superciliously , "
90422	90621	90420	90420	Planchette	436	" They all talk to us pretty much as the _ incroyable _ did when he brought some ladies to see Lalande just after an eclipse , and remarked , ' Be so good as to begin it over again ! ' What effect do you want to produce ? The object of the science of mechanics is either the application or the neutralization of the laws of motion . As for motion pure and simple , I tell you humbly , that we can not possibly define it . That disposed of , unvarying phenomena have been observed which accompany the actions of solids and fluids . If we set up the conditions by which these phenomena are brought to pass , we can transport bodies or communicate locomotive power to them at a predetermined rate of speed . We can project them , divide them up in a few or an infinite number of pieces , accordingly as we break them or grind them to powder ; we can twist bodies or make them rotate , modify , compress , expand , or extend them . The whole science , sir , rests upon a single fact .
90622	90628	90629	90629	he	436	" You see this ball , "
90633	91017	90629	90629	he	436	" here it lies upon this slab . Now , it is over there . What name shall we give to what has taken place , so natural from a physical point of view , so amazing from a moral ? Movement , locomotion , changing of place ? What prodigious vanity lurks underneath the words . Does a name solve the difficulty ? Yet it is the whole of our science for all that . Our machines either make direct use of this agency , this fact , or they convert it . This trifling phenomenon , applied to large masses , would send Paris flying . We can increase speed by an expenditure of force , and augment the force by an increase of speed . But what are speed and force ? Our science is as powerless to tell us that as to create motion . Any movement whatever is an immense power , and man does not create power of any kind . Everything is movement , thought itself is a movement , upon movement nature is based . Death is a movement whose limitations are little known . If God is eternal , be sure that He moves perpetually ; perhaps God is movement . That is why movement , like God is inexplicable , unfathomable , unlimited , incomprehensible , intangible . Who has ever touched , comprehended , or measured movement ? We feel its effects without seeing it ; we can even deny them as we can deny the existence of a God . Where is it ? Where is it not ? Whence comes it ? What is its source ? What is its end ? It surrounds us , it intrudes upon us , and yet escapes us . It is evident as a fact , obscure as an abstraction ; it is at once effect and cause . It requires space , even as we , and what is space ? Movement alone recalls it to us ; without movement , space is but an empty meaningless word . Like space , like creation , like the infinite , movement is an insoluble problem which confounds human reason ; man will never conceive it , whatever else he may be permitted to conceive .
91018	91031	91033	91036	the man of science	1145	" Between each point in space occupied in succession by that ball , "
91038	91226	91033	91036	the man of science	1145	" there is an abyss confronting human reason , an abyss into which Pascal fell . In order to produce any effect upon an unknown substance , we ought first of all to study that substance ; to know whether , in accordance with its nature , it will be broken by the force of a blow , or whether it will withstand it ; if it breaks in pieces , and you have no wish to split it up , we shall not achieve the end proposed . If you want to compress it , a uniform impulse must be communicated to all the particles of the substance , so as to diminish the interval that separates them in an equal degree . If you wish to expand it , we should try to bring a uniform eccentric force to bear on every molecule ; for unless we conform accurately to this law , we shall have breaches in continuity . The modes of motion , sir , are infinite , and no limit exists to combinations of movement . Upon what effect have you determined ? "
91227	91244	91246	91246	Raphael	360	" I want any kind of pressure that is strong enough to expand the skin indefinitely , "
91253	91258	91259	91260	the mathematician	1737	" Substance is finite , "
91264	91304	91259	91260	the mathematician	1737	" and therefore will not admit of indefinite expansion , but pressure will necessarily increase the extent of surface at the expense of the thickness , which will be diminished until the point is reached when the material gives out---- "
91305	91313	91314	91314	Raphael	360	" Bring about that result , sir , "
91317	91325	91314	91314	Raphael	360	" and you will have earned millions . "
91326	91336	91338	91339	the other	855	" Then I should rob you of your money , "
91346	91411	91343	91344	a Dutchman	1739	" I am going to show you , in a word or two , that a machine can be made that is fit to crush Providence itself in pieces like a fly . It would reduce a man to the conditions of a piece of waste paper ; a man -- boots and spurs , hat and cravat , trinkets and gold , and all---- "
91412	91418	91314	91314	Raphael	360	" What a fearful machine ! "
91419	91440	91441	91444	the man of science	1145	" Instead of flinging their brats into the water , the Chinese ought to make them useful in this way , "
91569	91578	91579	91579	he	436	" There are the rudiments of the apparatus , "
91775	91781	91782	91782	he	436	" This apparatus , sir , "
91799	91813	91782	91782	he	436	" is one of the great Pascal 's grandest claims upon our admiration . "
91814	91820	91782	91782	he	436	" I do n't understand . "
91951	91967	91969	91970	the mechanician	1730	" Water is considered to - day , sir , to be an incompressible body , "
91972	92023	91969	91970	the mechanician	1730	" never lose sight of that fundamental principle ; still it can be compressed , though only so very slightly that we should regard its faculty for contracting as a zero . You see the amount of surface presented by the water at the brim of the flower - pot ? "
92024	92029	91913	91913	he	436	" Yes , sir . "
92030	92066	91969	91970	the mechanician	1730	" Very good ; now suppose that that surface is a thousand times larger than the orifice of the elder stem through which I poured the liquid . Here , I am taking the funnel away---- "
92067	92070	91913	91913	he	436	" Granted . "
92071	92133	91969	91970	the mechanician	1730	" Well , then , if by any method whatever I increase the volume of that quantity of water by pouring in yet more through the mouth of the little tube ; the water thus compelled to flow downwards would rise in the reservoir , represented by the flower - pot , until it reached the same level at either end . "
92134	92140	92142	92142	Raphael	360	" That is quite clear , "
92144	92151	92152	92153	the other	855	" But there is this difference , "
92157	92267	92269	92269	Planchette	436	" Suppose that the thin column of water poured into the little vertical tube there exerts a force equal , say , to a pound weight , for instance , its action will be punctually communicated to the great body of the liquid , and will be transmitted to every part of the surface represented by the water in the flower - pot so that at the surface there will be a thousand columns of water , every one pressing upwards as if they were impelled by a force equal to that which compels the liquid to descend in the vertical tube ; and of necessity they reproduce here , "
92282	92294	92269	92269	Planchette	436	" the force introduced over there , a thousand - fold , "
92314	92320	92322	92322	Raphael	360	" That is quite simple , "
92328	92333	92334	92334	he	436	" In other words , "
92348	92420	92334	92334	he	436	" in order to resist the force of the incoming water , it would be necessary to exert , upon every part of the large surface , a force equal to that brought into action in the vertical column , but with this difference -- if the column of liquid is a foot in height , the thousand little columns of the wide surface will only have a very slight elevating power .
92421	92424	92429	92429	he	436	" Now , "
92439	92602	92603	92603	he	436	" let us replace this funny little apparatus by steel tubes of suitable strength and dimensions ; and if you cover the liquid surface of the reservoir with a strong sliding plate of metal , and if to this metal plate you oppose another , solid enough and strong enough to resist any test ; if , furthermore , you give me the power of continually adding water to the volume of liquid contents by means of the little vertical tube , the object fixed between the two solid metal plates must of necessity yield to the tremendous crushing force which indefinitely compresses it . The method of continually pouring in water through a little tube , like the manner of communicating force through the volume of the liquid to a small metal plate , is an absurdly primitive mechanical device . A brace of pistons and a few valves would do it all . Do you perceive , my dear sir , "
92611	92636	92603	92603	he	436	" there is scarcely a substance in existence that would not be compelled to dilate when fixed in between these two indefinitely resisting surfaces ? "
92637	92651	92652	92652	Raphael	360	" What ! the author of the _ Lettres provinciales _ invented it ? "
92655	92726	92603	92603	he	436	" He and no other , sir . The science of mechanics knows no simpler nor more beautiful contrivance . The opposite principle , the capacity of expansion possessed by water , has brought the steam - engine into being . But water will only expand up to a certain point , while its incompressibility , being a force in a manner negative , is , of necessity , infinite . "
92727	92734	92736	92736	Raphael	360	" If this skin is expanded , "
92738	92806	92736	92736	Raphael	360	" I promise you to erect a colossal statue to Blaise Pascal ; to found a prize of a hundred thousand francs to be offered every ten years for the solution of the grandest problem of mechanical science effected during the interval ; to find dowries for all your cousins and second cousins , and finally to build an asylum on purpose for impoverished or insane mathematicians . "
92807	92814	92815	92815	Planchette	436	" That would be exceedingly useful , "
92818	92830	92831	92831	he	436	" We will go to Spieghalter to - morrow , sir , "
92847	92879	92831	92831	he	436	" That distinguished mechanic has just completed , after my own designs , an improved mechanical arrangement by which a child could get a thousand trusses of hay inside his cap . "
92880	92890	92736	92736	Raphael	360	" Then good - bye till to - morrow . "
92891	92899	92831	92831	he	436	" Till to - morrow , sir . "
92900	92905	92907	92907	Raphael	360	" Talk of mechanics ! "
92909	92955	92907	92907	Raphael	360	" is n't it the greatest of the sciences ? The other fellow with his onagers , classifications , ducks , and species , and his phials full of bottled monstrosities , is at best only fit for a billiard - marker in a saloon . "
93199	93212	93214	93214	Spieghalter	442	" If you were to give seven rapid turns to that crank , "
93224	93247	93214	93214	Spieghalter	442	" you would make a steel bar spurt out in thousands of jets , that would get into your legs like needles . "
93248	93252	93254	93254	Raphael	360	" The deuce ! "
93291	93304	93306	93306	Spieghalter	442	" Lie flat , all of you ; we are dead men ! "
93370	93373	93375	93375	Planchette	436	" Ha ! "
93378	93408	93375	93375	Planchette	436	" the piece of skin is as safe and sound as my eye . There was a flaw in your reservoir somewhere , or a crevice in the large tube---- "
93409	93434	93436	93437	the German	1763	" No , no ; I know my reservoir . The devil is in your contrivance , sir ; you can take it away , "
93478	93490	93492	93492	Planchette	436	" There is not so much as a mark on it ! "
93623	93630	93632	93632	Raphael	360	" Hand it over to me , "
93684	93694	93696	93696	Raphael	360	" There is certainly something infernal in the thing ! "
93701	93716	93696	93696	Raphael	360	" Is no human power able to give me one more day of existence ? "
93717	93725	93727	93728	the mathematician	1737	" I made a mistake , sir , "
93735	93763	93727	93728	the mathematician	1737	" we ought to have subjected that peculiar skin to the action of a rolling machine . Where could my eyes have been when I suggested compression ! "
93764	93773	93774	93774	Raphael	360	" It was I that asked for it , "
93815	93846	93806	93806	he	1737	" This unknown material ought to be treated chemically by re - agents . Let us call on Japhet -- perhaps the chemist may have better luck than the mechanic . "
93870	93876	93877	93877	Planchette	436	" Well , old friend , "
93890	93895	93877	93877	Planchette	436	" how goes chemistry ? "
93896	93931	93877	93877	Planchette	436	" Gone to sleep . Nothing new at all . The Academie , however , has recognized the existence of salicine , but salicine , asparagine , vauqueline , and digitaline are not really discoveries---- "
93932	93940	93942	93942	Raphael	360	" Since you can not invent substances , "
93944	93955	93942	93942	Raphael	360	" you are obliged to fall back on inventing names . "
93956	93964	93877	93877	Planchette	436	" Most emphatically true , young man . "
93965	93968	93970	93970	Planchette	436	" Here , "
93976	94013	93970	93970	Planchette	436	" try to analyze this composition ; if you can extract any element whatever from it , I christen it diaboline beforehand , for we have just smashed a hydraulic press in trying to compress it . "
94014	94027	94029	94031	the delighted chemist	1781	" Let 's see ! let 's have a look at it ! "
94033	94044	94029	94031	the delighted chemist	1781	" it may , perhaps , be a fresh element . "
94045	94060	94062	94062	Raphael	360	" It is simply a piece of the skin of an ass , sir , "
94064	94067	94069	94071	the illustrious chemist	1782	" Sir ! "
94074	94080	94081	94082	the Marquis	4624	" I am not joking , "
94128	94146	94125	94125	he	443	" No taste whatever ! Come , we will give it a little fluoric acid to drink . "
94166	94174	94175	94176	the chemist	4972	" It is not shagreen at all ! "
94179	94210	94175	94176	the chemist	4972	" We will treat this unknown mystery as a mineral , and try its mettle by dropping it in a crucible where I have at this moment some red potash . "
94220	94235	94236	94236	he	443	" Allow me to cut away a bit of this strange substance , sir , "
94241	94246	94236	94236	he	443	" it is so extraordinary---- "
94247	94251	94253	94253	Raphael	360	" A bit ! "
94255	94271	94272	94272	he	443	" not so much as a hair's - breadth . You may try , though , "
94387	94395	94396	94396	Raphael	360	" It is all over with me , "
94399	94410	94412	94412	he	360	" It is the finger of God ! I shall die!---- "
94420	94444	94445	94445	Planchette	436	" We must be very careful not to talk about this affair at the Academie ; our colleagues there would laugh at us , "
94522	94531	94533	94533	Planchette	436	" A hydraulic press broken like a biscuit ! "
94535	94542	94544	94546	the Baron Japhet	443	" I believe in the devil , "
94554	94560	94562	94562	Planchette	436	" And I in God , "
94605	94613	94614	94615	the chemist	4972	" We can not deny the fact , "
94618	94639	94564	94564	Each	856	" Pshaw ! those gentlemen the doctrinaires have invented a nebulous aphorism for our consolation -- Stupid as a fact . "
94640	94644	94646	94647	the chemist	4972	" Your aphorism , "
94649	94659	94646	94647	the chemist	4972	" seems to me as a fact very stupid . "
94806	94811	94812	94812	he	360	" I am mad , "
94815	94846	94812	94812	he	360	" I have had no food since the morning , and yet I am neither hungry nor thirsty , and there is a fire in my breast that burns me . "
94884	94889	94890	94890	he	360	" Eight o'clock already ! "
94893	94903	94890	94890	he	360	" To - day has gone like a dream . "
94945	94949	94950	94950	he	360	" O Pauline ! "
94953	94973	94950	94950	he	360	" Poor child ! there are gulfs that love can never traverse , despite the strength of his wings . "
95003	95010	95011	95011	he	360	" That is my death warrant , "
95016	95031	95011	95011	he	360	" If she were there , I should wish to die in her arms . "
95095	95100	95102	95102	she	336	" I cajoled Jonathan , "
95104	95145	95102	95102	she	336	" Does n't the bed belong to me , to me who am your wife ? Do n't scold me , darling ; I only wanted to surprise you , to sleep beside you . Forgive me for my freak . "
95171	95181	95182	95182	she	336	" Love , what gulf were you talking about ? "
95194	95197	95191	95191	her	336	" Death . "
95198	95203	95204	95204	she	336	" You hurt me , "
95207	95256	95257	95257	she	336	" There are some thoughts upon which we , poor women that we are , can not dwell ; they are death to us . Is it strength of love in us , or lack of courage ? I can not tell . Death does not frighten me , "
95263	95329	95257	95257	she	336	" To die with you , both together , to - morrow morning , in one last embrace , would be joy . It seems to me that even then I should have lived more than a hundred years . What does the number of days matter if we have spent a whole lifetime of peace and love in one night , in one hour ? "
95330	95357	95359	95359	Raphael	360	" You are right ; Heaven is speaking through that pretty mouth of yours . Grant that I may kiss you , and let us die , "
95361	95367	95368	95368	she	336	" Then let us die , "
95518	95524	95525	95525	he	360	" For me to die , "
95537	95594	95525	95525	he	360	" my organization , the mechanism of flesh and bone , that is quickened by the will in me , and makes of me an individual MAN , must display some perceptible disease . Doctors ought to understand the symptoms of any attack on vitality , and could tell me whether I am sick or sound . "
96236	96241	96242	96242	she	336	" Good - morning , "
96247	96256	96242	96242	she	336	" How handsome you are , bad man ! "
96359	96366	96368	96368	Raphael	360	" What made me wake you ? "
96370	96389	96368	96368	Raphael	360	" It was so great a pleasure to watch you sleeping that it brought tears to my eyes . "
96390	96397	96398	96398	she	336	" And to mine , too , "
96401	96506	96507	96507	she	1828	" I cried in the night while I watched you sleeping , but not with happiness . Raphael , dear , pray listen to me . Your breathing is labored while you sleep , and something rattles in your chest that frightens me . You have a little dry cough when you are asleep , exactly like my father 's , who is dying of phthisis . In those sounds from your lungs I recognized some of the peculiar symptoms of that complaint . Then you are feverish ; I know you are ; your hand was moist and burning----Darling , you are young , "
96513	96526	96527	96527	she	1828	" and you could still get over it if unfortunately----But , no , "
96531	96549	96507	96507	she	1828	" there is no ' unfortunately , ' the disease is contagious , so the doctors say . "
96574	96585	96586	96586	she	1828	" I do not wish to live to old age , "
96589	96606	96586	96586	she	1828	" Let us both die young , and go to heaven while flowers fill our hands . "
96607	96622	96623	96623	Raphael	360	" We always make such designs as those when we are well and strong , "
96756	96767	96768	96768	she	1828	" Let us commit no more follies , my angel , "
96847	96866	96844	96844	she	336	" Yes , there are gulfs that love can never cross , and therein love must bury itself . "
97190	97218	97230	97230	He	360	" You have been living at a great pace , leading a dissipated life , no doubt , and you have devoted yourself largely to intellectual work ? "
97259	97290	97291	97291	Raphael	360	" I made up my mind to kill myself with debauchery , after spending three years over an extensive work , with which perhaps you may some day occupy yourselves , "
97307	97314	97315	97315	he	1854	" I was sure of it , "
97459	97462	97455	97460	the head of the " Vitalists	5002	" Vitalists , "
97712	97732	97733	97733	he	450	" I should very much like to be a witness of the coincidence of its retrenchment with your wish , "
97739	97745	97747	97747	Brisset	447	" Where is the use ? "
97749	97755	97757	97757	Cameristus	450	" Where is the use ? "
97759	97770	97772	97772	Maugredie	452	" Ah , you are both of the same mind , "
97774	97781	97782	97782	Brisset	447	" The contraction is perfectly simple , "
97786	97791	97793	97793	Cameristus	450	" It is supernatural , "
97795	97799	97800	97800	Maugredie	452	" In short , "
97820	97856	97817	97817	he	450	" the shriveling faculty of the skin is a fact inexplicable , and yet quite natural , which , ever since the world began , has been the despair of medicine and of pretty women . "
97945	97951	97937	97937	Brisset	447	" Good ! just so ! "
98144	98156	98157	98157	Valentin	360	" May I not be present during the discussion , gentlemen ? "
98223	98229	98231	98231	Brisset	447	" Permit me , gentlemen , "
98237	98354	98355	98355	he	447	" to give you my own opinion at once . I neither wish to force it upon you nor to have it discussed . In the first place , it is unbiased , concise , and based on an exact similarity that exists between one of my own patients and the subject that we have been called in to examine ; and , moreover , I am expected at my hospital . The importance of the case that demands my presence there will excuse me for speaking the first word . The subject with which we are concerned has been exhausted in an equal degree by intellectual labors -- what did he set about , Horace ? "
98362	98371	98355	98355	he	447	" A ' Theory of the Will , ' "
98372	98808	98809	98809	he	1897	" The devil ! but that 's a big subject . He is exhausted , I say , by too much brain - work , by irregular courses , and by the repeated use of too powerful stimulants . Violent exertion of body and mind has demoralized the whole system . It is easy , gentlemen , to recognize in the symptoms of the face and body generally intense irritation of the stomach , an affection of the great sympathetic nerve , acute sensibility of the epigastric region , and contraction of the right and left hypochondriac . You have noticed , too , the large size and prominence of the liver . M. Bianchon has , besides , constantly watched the patient , and he tells us that digestion is troublesome and difficult . Strictly speaking , there is no stomach left , and so the man has disappeared . The brain is atrophied because the man digests no longer . The progressive deterioration wrought in the epigastric region , the seat of vitality , has vitiated the whole system . Thence , by continuous fevered vibrations , the disorder has reached the brain by means of the nervous plexus , hence the excessive irritation in that organ . There is monomania . The patient is burdened with a fixed idea . That piece of skin really contracts , to his way of thinking ; very likely it always has been as we have seen it ; but whether it contracts or no , that thing is for him just like the fly that some Grand Vizier or other had on his nose . If you put leeches at once on the epigastrium , and reduce the irritation in that part , which is the very seat of man 's life , and if you diet the patient , the monomania will leave him . I will say no more to Dr. Bianchon ; he should be able to grasp the whole treatment as well as the details . There may be , perhaps , some complication of the disease -- the bronchial tubes , possibly , may be also inflamed ; but I believe that treatment for the intestinal organs is very much more important and necessary , and more urgently required than for the lungs . Persistent study of abstract matters , and certain violent passions , have induced serious disorders in that vital mechanism . However , we are in time to set these conditions right . Nothing is too seriously affected . You will easily get your friend round again , "
98814	98826	98827	98827	Cameristus	450	" Our learned colleague is taking the effect for the cause , "
98830	98930	98827	98827	Cameristus	450	" Yes , the changes that he has observed so keenly certainly exist in the patient ; but it is not the stomach that , by degrees , has set up nervous action in the system , and so affected the brain , like a hole in a window pane spreading cracks round about it . It took a blow of some kind to make a hole in the window ; who gave the blow ? Do we know that ? Have we investigated the patient 's case sufficiently ? Are we acquainted with all the events of his life ?
98931	98938	98939	98939	he	1897	" The vital principle , gentlemen , "
98942	99040	99041	99041	he	1897	" the Archeus of Van Helmont , is affected in his case -- the very essence and centre of life is attacked . The divine spark , the transitory intelligence which holds the organism together , which is the source of the will , the inspiration of life , has ceased to regulate the daily phenomena of the mechanism and the functions of every organ ; thence arise all the complications which my learned colleague has so thoroughly appreciated . The epigastric region does not affect the brain but the brain affects the epigastric region . No , "
99050	99100	99041	99041	he	1897	" no , I am not a stomach in the form of a man . No , everything does not lie there . I do not feel that I have the courage to say that if the epigastric region is in good order , everything else is in a like condition----
99101	99107	99108	99108	he	1897	" We can not trace , "
99114	99454	99108	99108	he	1897	" to one physical cause the serious disturbances that supervene in this or that subject which has been dangerously attacked , nor submit them to a uniform treatment . No one man is like another . We have each peculiar organs , differently affected , diversely nourished , adapted to perform different functions , and to induce a condition necessary to the accomplishment of an order of things which is unknown to us . The sublime will has so wrought that a little portion of the great All is set within us to sustain the phenomena of living ; in every man it formulates itself distinctly , making each , to all appearance , a separate individual , yet in one point co - existent with the infinite cause . So we ought to make a separate study of each subject , discover all about it , find out in what its life consists , and wherein its power lies . From the softness of a wet sponge to the hardness of pumice - stone there are infinite fine degrees of difference . Man is just like that . Between the sponge - like organizations of the lymphatic and the vigorous iron muscles of such men as are destined for a long life , what a margin for errors for the single inflexible system of a lowering treatment to commit ; a system that reduces the capacities of the human frame , which you always conclude have been over - excited . Let us look for the origin of the disease in the mental and not in the physical viscera . A doctor is an inspired being , endowed by God with a special gift -- the power to read the secrets of vitality ; just as the prophet has received the eyes that foresee the future , the poet his faculty of evoking nature , and the musician the power of arranging sounds in an harmonious order that is possibly a copy of an ideal harmony on high . "
99455	99471	99473	99473	Brisset	447	" There is his everlasting system of medicine , arbitrary , monarchical , and pious , "
99475	99478	99479	99479	Maugredie	452	" Gentlemen , "
99492	99503	99479	99479	Maugredie	452	" do n't let us lose sight of the patient . "
99504	99512	99513	99513	Raphael	360	" What is the good of science ? "
99516	99641	99513	99513	Raphael	360	" Here is my recovery halting between a string of beads and a rosary of leeches , between Dupuytren 's bistoury and Prince Hohenlohe 's prayer . There is Maugredie suspending his judgment on the line that divides facts from words , mind from matter . Man 's ' it is , ' and ' it is not , ' is always on my track ; it is the _ Carymary Carymara _ of Rabelais for evermore : my disorder is spiritual , _ Carymary _ , or material , _ Carymara _ . Shall I live ? They have no idea . Planchette was more straightforward with me , at any rate , when he said , ' I do not know . ' "
99650	99667	99668	99668	he	452	" The patient suffers from monomania ; very good , I am quite of that opinion , "
99671	99813	99668	99668	he	452	" but he has two hundred thousand a year ; monomaniacs of that kind are very uncommon . As for knowing whether his epigastric region has affected his brain , or his brain his epigastric region , we shall find that out , perhaps , whenever he dies . But to resume . There is no disputing the fact that he is ill ; some sort of treatment he must have . Let us leave theories alone , and put leeches on him , to counteract the nervous and intestinal irritation , as to the existence of which we all agree ; and let us send him to drink the waters , in that way we shall act on both systems at once . If there really is tubercular disease , we can hardly expect to save his life ; so that---- "
99843	99847	99848	99848	he	446	" These gentlemen , "
99852	99896	99848	99848	he	446	" have unanimously agreed that leeches must be applied to the stomach at once , and that both physical and moral treatment are imperatively needed . In the first place , a carefully prescribed rule of diet , so as to soothe the internal irritation"--here
99902	99974	99897	99897	Brisset	447	" and in the second , a hygienic regimen , to set your general condition right . We all , therefore , recommend you to go to take the waters in Aix in Savoy ; or , if you like it better , at Mont Dore in Auvergne ; the air and the situation are both pleasanter in Savoy than in the Cantal , but you will consult your own taste . "
99983	99987	99988	99988	Bianchon	446	" These gentlemen , "
99991	100049	99988	99988	Bianchon	446	" having recognized a slight affection of the respiratory organs , are agreed as to the utility of the previous course of treatment that I have prescribed . They think that there will be no difficulty about restoring you to health , and that everything depends upon a wise and alternate employment of these various means . And---- "
100050	100063	100065	100065	Raphael	360	" And that is the cause of the milk in the cocoanut , "
100087	100093	100094	100096	the young doctor	1896	" Their conclusions are logical , "
100099	100252	100094	100096	the young doctor	1896	" Cameristus feels , Brisset examines , Maugredie doubts . Has not man a soul , a body , and an intelligence ? One of these three elemental constituents always influences us more or less strongly ; there will always be the personal element in human science . Believe me , Raphael , we effect no cures ; we only assist them . Another system -- the use of mild remedies while Nature exerts her powers -- lies between the extremes of theory of Brisset and Cameristus , but one ought to have known the patient for some ten years or so to obtain a good result on these lines . Negation lies at the back of all medicine , as in every other science . So endeavor to live wholesomely ; try a trip to Savoy ; the best course is , and always will be , to trust to Nature . "
100441	100456	100458	100460	an old lady	1909	" Will you be so kind as not to close the windows , sir ? "
100462	100467	100458	100460	an old lady	1909	" we are being stifled---- "
100556	100561	100554	100554	him	3807	" Open that window . "
101353	101359	101423	101423	Raphael	360	" His complaint is contagious . "
101360	101375	101423	101423	Raphael	360	" The president of the Club ought to forbid him to enter the salon . "
101376	101391	101423	101423	Raphael	360	" It is contrary to all rules and regulations to cough in that way ! "
101392	101411	101423	101423	Raphael	360	" When a man is as ill as that , he ought not to come to take the waters---- "
101412	101422	101423	101423	Raphael	360	" He will drive me away from the place . "
101790	101796	101767	101772	the Roman youth at the circus	1947	" Death to the weak ! "
102467	102485	102486	102486	he	360	" I have only to let them know my power to make them worship my coughing fits , "
102664	102669	102671	102671	he	1987	" My Lord Marquis , "
102680	102799	102671	102671	he	1987	" I can dispel your uneasiness beyond all doubt . I know your constitution well enough by this time to assure you that the doctors in Paris , whose great abilities I know , are mistaken as to the nature of your complaint . You can live as long as Methuselah , my Lord Marquis , accidents only excepted . Your lungs are as sound as a blacksmith 's bellows , your stomach would put an ostrich to the blush ; but if you persist in living at high altitude , you are running the risk of a prompt interment in consecrated soil . A few words , my Lord Marquis , will make my meaning clear to you .
102800	102803	102804	102804	he	1990	" Chemistry , "
102807	103012	103013	103013	he	1991	" has shown us that man 's breathing is a real process of combustion , and the intensity of its action varies according to the abundance or scarcity of the phlogistic element stored up by the organism of each individual . In your case , the phlogistic , or inflammatory element is abundant ; if you will permit me to put it so , you generate superfluous oxygen , possessing as you do the inflammatory temperament of a man destined to experience strong emotions . While you breath the keen , pure air that stimulates life in men of lymphatic constitution , you are accelerating an expenditure of vitality already too rapid . One of the conditions for existence for you is the heavier atmosphere of the plains and valleys . Yes , the vital air for a man consumed by his genius lies in the fertile pasture - lands of Germany , at Toplitz or Baden - Baden . If England is not obnoxious to you , its misty climate would reduce your fever ; but the situation of our baths , a thousand feet above the level of the Mediterranean , is dangerous for you . That is my opinion at least , "
103021	103046	103013	103013	he	1991	" and I give it in opposition to our interests , for , if you act upon it , we shall unfortunately lose you . "
103199	103209	103211	103211	he	360	" As you would be grieved at losing me , "
103216	103256	103211	103211	he	360	" I will endeavor to avail myself of your good advice without leaving the place . I will set about having a house built to - morrow , and the atmosphere within it shall be regulated by your instructions . "
104146	104163	104164	104164	she	2066	" Your life is in danger , sir ; do not come to the Club again ! "
104185	104190	104192	104192	Raphael	360	" But , mademoiselle , "
104196	104209	104192	104192	Raphael	360	" please explain yourself more clearly , since you have condescended so far---- "
104210	104213	104214	104214	she	2066	" Ah , "
104217	104251	104214	104214	she	2066	" unless I had had a very strong motive , I should never have run the risk of offending the countess , for if she ever came to know that I had warned you---- "
104252	104261	104263	104263	Raphael	360	" And who would tell her , mademoiselle ? "
104265	104268	104269	104271	the old maid	2070	" True , "
104288	104294	104295	104295	she	2070	" But think of yourself , "
104299	104331	104295	104295	she	2070	" several young men , who want to drive you away from the baths , have agreed to pick a quarrel with you , and to force you into a duel . "
104342	104345	104347	104348	the Marquis	4624	" Mademoiselle , "
104350	104353	104347	104348	the Marquis	4624	" my gratitude---- "
104375	104387	104388	104388	Raphael	360	" Poor girl ! unhappiness always understands and helps the unhappy , "
104503	104522	104524	104524	he	360	" It is not at all extraordinary that a gentlewoman 's gentlewoman should take a fancy to me , "
104528	104643	104524	104524	he	360	" I am twenty - seven years old , and I have a title and an income of two hundred thousand a year . But that her mistress , who hates water like a rabid cat -- for it would be hard to give the palm to either in that matter -- that her mistress should have brought her here in a boat ! Is not that very strange and wonderful ? Those two women came into Savoy to sleep like marmots ; they ask if day has dawned at noon ; and to think that they could get up this morning before eight o'clock , to take their chances in running after me ! "
104928	104931	104898	104898	they	2090	" You ? "
104932	104936	104898	104898	they	2090	" Yes , I. "
104937	104945	104898	104898	they	2090	" I dare you to do it ! "
104946	104955	104898	104898	they	2090	" Let us make a bet on it ! "
104956	104964	104898	104898	they	2090	" Oh , he will do it . "
105028	105035	105036	105036	he	360	" I am deputed , sir , "
105043	105107	105036	105036	he	360	" to make you aware of something which you do not seem to know ; your face and person generally are a source of annoyance to every one here , and to me in particular . You have too much politeness not to sacrifice yourself to the public good , and I beg that you will not show yourself in the Club again . "
105108	105138	105140	105140	Raphael	360	" This sort of joke has been perpetrated before , sir , in garrison towns at the time of the Empire ; but nowadays it is exceedingly bad form , "
105143	105149	105150	105152	the young man	493	" I am not joking , "
105155	105194	105150	105152	the young man	493	" and I repeat it : your health will be considerably the worse for a stay here ; the heat and light , the air of the saloon , and the company are all bad for your complaint . "
105195	105202	105203	105203	Raphael	360	" Where did you study medicine ? "
105206	105236	105150	105152	the young man	493	" I took my bachelor 's degree on Lepage 's shooting - ground in Paris , and was made a doctor at Cerizier 's , the king of foils . "
105237	105249	105251	105251	Valentin	360	" There is one last degree left for you to take , "
105253	105269	105251	105251	Valentin	360	" study the ordinary rules of politeness , and you will be a perfect gentlemen . "
105363	105397	105359	105359	he	360	" We can not box men 's ears , sir , in these days , but I am at a loss for any word by which to stigmatize such cowardly behavior as yours . "
105398	105417	105418	105420	several young men	2102	" That 's enough , that 's enough . You can come to an explanation to - morrow , "
105522	105536	105537	105537	he	360	" We shall do very nicely here ; glorious weather for a duel ! "
105572	105578	105579	105579	he	360	" If I wing him , "
105583	105598	105579	105579	he	360	" I shall send him to bed for a month ; eh , doctor ? "

105610	105643	105606	105607	the surgeon	1864	" but let that willow twig alone , or you will weary your wrist , and then you will not fire steadily . You might kill your man instead of wounding him . "
105653	105658	105660	105661	the seconds	2117	" Here he is , "
105686	105692	105694	105694	Valentin	360	" What a queer proceeding ! "
105698	105709	105694	105694	Valentin	360	" here he comes post - haste to be shot . "
105938	105948	105950	105950	Raphael	360	" I have not slept all night , sir ; "
106026	106032	106033	106033	he	360	" There is yet time , "
106037	106216	106033	106033	he	360	" to offer me some slight apology ; and offer it you must , or you will die sir ! You rely even now on your dexterity , and do not shrink from an encounter in which you believe all the advantage to be upon your side . Very good , sir ; I am generous , I am letting you know my superiority beforehand . I possess a terrible power . I have only to wish to do so , and I can neutralize your skill , dim your eyesight , make your hand and pulse unsteady , and even kill you outright . I have no wish to be compelled to exercise my power ; the use of it costs me too dear . You would not be the only one to die . So if you refuse to apologize to me , not matter what your experience in murder , your ball will go into the waterfall there , and mine will speed straight to your heart though I do not aim it at you . "
106264	106271	106272	106274	the young man	493	" Make him hold his tongue , "
106283	106296	106272	106274	the young man	493	" that voice of his is tearing the heart out of me . "
106297	106309	106314	106315	the surgeon	1864	" Say no more , sir ; it is quite useless , "
106320	106339	106272	106274	the young man	493	" Gentlemen , I am fulfilling a duty . Has this young gentleman any final arrangements to make ? "
106340	106349	106314	106315	the surgeon	1864	" That is enough ; that will do . "
106405	106414	106415	106415	he	4624	" I am thirsty ; give me some water---- "
106422	106427	106415	106415	he	4624	" Are you nervous ? "
106428	106431	106432	106432	he	4624	" Yes , "
106435	106447	106432	106432	he	4624	" There is a fascination about that man 's glowing eyes . "
106448	106453	106415	106415	he	4624	" Will you apologize ? "
106454	106461	106432	106432	he	4624	" It is too late now . "
106519	106527	106529	106539	the young man who acted as second to Raphael 's antagonist	2159	" What are you doing , Charles ? "

109194	109230	109231	109231	she	2272	" What should we be afraid of , sir ? When we bolt the door , who ever could get inside ? Oh , no , we are n't afraid at all . And besides , "
109247	109258	109231	109231	she	2272	" what should thieves come to take from us here ? "
109286	109291	109264	109264	she	2272	" End of Credit , "

109395	109403	109405	109412	the Auvergnate , unconsciously smiling in peasant fashion	2289	" That 's my man , sir , "
109414	109422	109405	109412	the Auvergnate , unconsciously smiling in peasant fashion	2289	" he is at work up there . "
109423	109432	109374	109375	a man	2534	" And that old man is your father ? "
109433	109526	109405	109412	the Auvergnate , unconsciously smiling in peasant fashion	2289	" Asking your pardon , sir , he is my man 's grandfather . Such as you see him , he is a hundred and two , and yet quite lately he walked over to Clermont with our little chap ! Oh , he has been a strong man in his time ; but he does nothing now but sleep and eat and drink . He amuses himself with the little fellow . Sometimes the child trails him up the hillsides , and he will just go up there along with him . "
110488	110495	110496	110496	she	2322	" No better and no worse , "
110499	110729	110496	110496	she	2322	" He coughed all last night again fit to kill himself . Poor gentleman , he coughs and spits till it is piteous . My husband and I often wonder to each other where he gets the strength from to cough like that . It goes to your heart . What a cursed complaint it is ! He has no strength at all . I am always afraid I shall find him dead in his bed some morning . He is every bit as pale as a waxen Christ . _ Dame _ ! I watch him while he dresses ; his poor body is as thin as a nail . And he does not feel well now ; but no matter . It 's all the same ; he wears himself out with running about as if he had health and to spare . All the same , he is very brave , for he never complains at all . But really he would be better under the earth than on it , for he is enduring the agonies of Christ . I do n't wish that myself , sir ; it is quite in our interests ; but even if he did n't pay us what he does , I should be just as fond of him ; it is not our own interest that is our motive .
110730	110738	110739	110739	she	2323	" Ah , _ mon Dieu _ ! "
110742	110890	110739	110739	she	2323	" Parisians are the people for these dogs ' diseases . Where did he catch it , now ? Poor young man ! And he is so sure that he is going to get well ! That fever just gnaws him , you know ; it eats him away ; it will be the death of him . He has no notion whatever of that ; he does not know it , sir ; he sees nothing----You must n't cry about him , M. Jonathan ; you must remember that he will be happy , and will not suffer any more . You ought to make a neuvaine for him ; I have seen wonderful cures come of the nine days ' prayer , and I would gladly pay for a wax taper to save such a gentle creature , so good he is , a paschal lamb---- "
110937	110941	110942	110942	he	360	" Old scoundrel ! "
110947	110957	110942	110942	he	360	" do you mean to put me to death ? "
110970	110983	110984	110984	Raphael	360	" I forbid you to have any anxiety whatever about my health , "
110988	110995	110997	110999	the old servant	1406	" Yes , my Lord Marquis , "
111006	111023	110997	110999	the old servant	1406	" And for the future you had very much better not come here without my orders . "
111099	111102	111090	111090	Jonathan	329	" My Lord---- "
111103	111110	111112	111113	the invalid	1835	" Go away , go away , "
111285	111294	111296	111296	she	2337	" The damp is falling now , sir , "
111298	111339	111296	111296	she	2337	" If you stop out there , you will go off just like rotten fruit . You must come in . It is n't healthy to breathe the damp , and you have taken nothing since the morning , besides . "
111340	111350	111351	111351	he	360	" _ Tonnerre de Dieu _ ! old witch , "
111354	111396	111351	111351	he	360	" let me live after my own fashion , I tell you , or I shall be off altogether . It is quite bad enough to dig my grave every morning ; you might let it alone in the evenings at least---- "
111397	111449	111296	111296	she	2337	" Your grave , sir ! I dig your grave!--and where may your grave be ? I want to see you as old as father there , and not in your grave by any manner of means . The grave ! that comes soon enough for us all ; in the grave---- "
111450	111455	111457	111457	Raphael	360	" That is enough , "
111459	111466	111296	111296	she	2337	" Take my arm , sir . "
111467	111470	111296	111296	she	2337	" No . "
112698	112731	112692	112692	He	360	" Gone ! This really is a flight , my Raphael . How is it ? No one can tell me where you are . And who should know if not I ? "
112818	112865	112804	112804	he	360	" Sitting at your door -- expected -- Caprice -- I obey -- Rivals -- I , never!--thy Pauline -- love -- no more of Pauline?--If you had wished to leave me for ever , you would not have deserted me -- Love eternal -- To die---- "
112892	112897	112899	112899	Pauline	336	" I have murmured , "
112902	113030	112899	112899	Pauline	336	" but I have never complained , my Raphael ! If you have left me so far behind you , it was doubtless because you wished to hide some heavy grief from me . Perhaps you will kill me one of these days , but you are too good to torture me . So do not go away from me like this . There ! I can bear the worst of torment , if only I am at your side . Any grief that you could cause me would not be grief . There is far more love in my heart for you than I have ever yet shown you . I can endure anything , except this weeping far away from you , this ignorance of your---- "
113068	113075	113076	113076	he	360	" Go and find M. Bianchon , "
113088	113121	113080	113080	Horace	446	" Can you prescribe a draught for me -- some mild opiate which will always keep me in a somnolent condition , a draught that will not be injurious although taken constantly . "
113122	113127	113128	113130	the young doctor	1896	" Nothing is easier , "
113133	113160	113128	113130	the young doctor	1896	" but you will have to keep on your feet for a few hours daily , at any rate , so as to take your food . "
113161	113166	113167	113167	Raphael	360	" A few hours ! "
113171	113190	113167	113167	Raphael	360	" no , no ! I only wish to be out of bed for an hour at most . "
113191	113197	113199	113199	Bianchon	446	" What is your object ? "
113201	113215	113216	113217	the patient	1890	" To sleep ; for so one keeps alive , at any rate , "
113220	113235	113236	113236	he	1896	" Let no one come in , not even Mlle . Pauline de Wistchnau ! "
113250	113261	113262	113264	the old servant	1406	" Well , M. Horace , is there any hope ? "
113284	113322	113324	113325	the doctor	1987	" He may live for some time yet , or he may die to - night . The chances of life and death are evenly balanced in his case . I ca n't understand it at all , "
113332	113340	113324	113325	the doctor	1987	" His mind ought to be diverted . "
113341	113368	113262	113264	the old servant	1406	" Diverted ! Ah , sir , you do n't know him ! He killed a man the other day without a word!--Nothing can divert him ! "
113559	113564	113565	113565	he	2407	" You can go , "
113568	113614	113565	113565	he	2407	" I have made you rich ; you shall be happy in your old age ; but I will not let you muddle away my life any longer . Miserable wretch ! I am hungry -- where is my dinner ? How is it?--Answer me ! "

114071	114084	114066	114066	Jonathan	329	" And M. Bianchon most certainly told me to divert his mind . "

114400	114408	114409	114409	she	336	" Ah , I have forgotten everything ! "
114418	114486	114409	114409	she	336	" I have no voice left except to tell you , ' I am yours . ' There is nothing in my heart but love . Angel of my life , you have never been so beautiful before ! Your eyes are blazing---- But come , I can guess it all . You have been in search of health without me ; you were afraid of me---- well---- "

114501	114524	114496	114496	Raphael	360	" Why do you not go ? If you stay , I shall die . Do you want to see me die ? "
114525	114528	114529	114529	she	2437	" Die ? "
114532	114553	114554	114554	she	2437	" Can you die without me ? Die ? But you are young ; and I love you ! Die ? "
114573	114576	114577	114577	she	2437	" Cold ! "
114580	114587	114577	114577	she	2437	" Is it all an illusion ? "
114618	114621	114622	114622	he	360	" Pauline ! "
114625	114640	114622	114622	he	360	" fair image of my fair life , let us say good - bye ? "
114641	114646	114647	114647	she	2437	" Good - bye ? "
114653	114697	114622	114622	he	360	" Yes . This is a talisman that grants me all my wishes , and that represents my span of life . See here , this is all that remains of it . If you look at me any longer , I shall die---- "
114803	114811	114840	114840	she	3349	" Pauline ! Pauline ! Come to me---- "
114893	114898	114900	114902	the dying man	2442	" Pauline ! Pauline ! "
114910	114933	114900	114902	the dying man	2442	" I love you , I adore you , I want you , Pauline ! I wish to die in your arms ! "
114984	114993	114994	114994	she	336	" If I die , he will live , "
115191	115197	115198	115198	she	2445	" What do you want ? "
115201	115220	115198	115198	she	2445	" He is mine , I have killed him . Did I not foresee how it would be ? "
115222	115229	115148	115148	he	2442	" And what became of Pauline ? "
115230	115447	115148	115148	he	2442	" Pauline ? Ah ! Do you sometimes spend a pleasant winter evening by your own fireside , and give yourself up luxuriously to memories of love or youth , while you watch the glow of the fire where the logs of oak are burning ? Here , the fire outlines a sort of chessboard in red squares , there it has a sheen like velvet ; little blue flames start up and flicker and play about in the glowing depths of the brasier . A mysterious artist comes and adapts that flame to his own ends ; by a secret of his own he draws a visionary face in the midst of those flaming violet and crimson hues , a face with unimaginable delicate outlines , a fleeting apparition which no chance will ever bring back again . It is a woman 's face , her hair is blown back by the wind , her features speak of a rapture of delight ; she breathes fire in the midst of the fire . She smiles , she dies , you will never see her any more . Farewell , flower of the flame ! Farewell , essence incomplete and unforeseen , come too early or too late to make the spark of some glorious diamond . "
115448	115453	115148	115148	he	2442	" But , Pauline ? "
115454	115762	115148	115148	he	2442	" You do not see , then ? I will begin again . Make way ! make way ! She comes , she is here , the queen of illusions , a woman fleeting as a kiss , a woman bright as lightning , issuing in a blaze like lightning from the sky , a being uncreated , of spirit and love alone . She has wrapped her shadowy form in flame , or perhaps the flame betokens that she exists but for a moment . The pure outlines of her shape tell you that she comes from heaven . Is she not radiant as an angel ? Can you not hear the beating of her wings in space ? She sinks down beside you more lightly than a bird , and you are entranced by her awful eyes ; there is a magical power in her light breathing that draws your lips to hers ; she flies and you follow ; you feel the earth beneath you no longer . If you could but once touch that form of snow with your eager , deluded hands , once twine the golden hair round your fingers , place one kiss on those shining eyes ! There is an intoxicating vapor around , and the spell of a siren music is upon you . Every nerve in you is quivering ; you are filled with pain and longing . O joy for which there is no name ! You have touched the woman 's lips , and you are awakened at once by a horrible pang . Oh ! ah ! yes , you have struck your head against the corner of the bedpost , you have been clasping its brown mahogany sides , and chilly gilt ornaments ; embracing a piece of metal , a brazen Cupid . "
115763	115771	115148	115148	he	2442	" But how about Pauline , sir ? "
115772	115990	115148	115148	he	2442	" What , again ? Listen . One lovely morning at Tours a young man , who held the hand of a pretty woman in his , went on board the _ Ville d'Angers _ . Thus united they both looked and wondered long at a white form that rose elusively out of the mists above the broad waters of the Loire , like some child of the sun and the river , or some freak of air and cloud . This translucent form was a sylph or a naiad by turns ; she hovered in the air like a word that haunts the memory , which seeks in vain to grasp it ; she glided among the islands , she nodded her head here and there among the tall poplar trees ; then she grew to a giant 's height ; she shook out the countless folds of her drapery to the light ; she shot light from the aureole that the sun had litten about her face ; she hovered above the slopes of the hills and their little hamlets , and seemed to bar the passage of the boat before the Chateau d'Usse . You might have thought that _ La dame des belles cousines _ sought to protect her country from modern intrusion . "
115991	116010	115148	115148	he	2442	" Well , well , I understand . So it went with Pauline . But how about Foedora ? "
116011	116055	115148	115148	he	2442	" Oh ! Foedora , you are sure to meet with her ! She was at the Bouffons last night , and she will go to the Opera this evening , and if you like to take it so , she is Society . "
